The new system sounds are played in the &quot;Speedy&quot; thread with high
regular priority. Check <CODE>fntSpeedyThread</CODE> and <CODE>fnwpSpeedyObject</CODE>
for details about how this is implemented using MMOS/2.

<P>Unfortunately, nowhere is documented how to access and modify the
system sounds that appear in the <B>&quot;Sound&quot; object.</B> I have accidently
discovered that
this is actually fairly easy: these are stored in <CODE>MMPM.INI</CODE> in the
MMOS/2 directory. Each sound has an index in that file, which I have
declared in <CODE>common.h</CODE> (those <CODE>MMSOUND_*</CODE> #define's).
These should be the
same on every system. The INI data then contains a
<CODE>&quot;&lt;soundfile&gt;#&lt;description&gt;#&lt;volume&gt;&quot;</CODE> string.
<P>
Sound data manipulation has been moved into a separate file with V0.9.0:
check <CODE>/helpers/syssound.c</CODE> for details. This now also supports
sound scheme manipulation.

<P>To make sure that the actual sound playing (which requires MMPM/2) also works on
systems where MMPM/2 is not installed, XWorkplace dynamically imports the functions
from the MMPM/2 DLLs. See src\media\* for details.
