Starting with V0.9.0, you can have HTML documentation created for the whole
XWorkplace code. This done using my own <CODE>xdoc</CODE> utility, which
can be found in the <CODE>TOOLS\</CODE> directory after XWorkplace has
been built for the first time.

<P><CODE>xdoc</CODE> is capable of parsing C/CPP source code and header files
to some extent. When certain codes are found in a comment in the sources
(e.g. <CODE>@@</CODE>), that comment is assumed to document some function
and will be considered for HTML output.

<P>After XWorkplace has been built for the first time, call <CODE>createdoc.cmd</CODE>
in the main directory, which will create the HTML documentation in a new
subdirectory of the code tree <CODE>HTML\</CODE>. Open
<CODE>index.html</CODE> then to get an index of all XWorkplace source files.
