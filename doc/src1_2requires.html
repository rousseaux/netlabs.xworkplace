<OL><LI><B>Compiler.</B> With V0.80, I have switched to <B>IBM VisualAge C++ 3.0</B>
to develop XWorkplace. For VAC++ 3.0, <B>fixpak 8</B> is strongly recommended,
because the original crashes frequently with the complex SOM header files.

<!-- V1.0.9 [rw]: changed to report compatibility with VAC 3.6.5 -->
<P>As of V1.0.9, XWorkplace should also compile successfully using VAC 3.6.5.
Other compilers are presently not supported.

<P><LI>You need some <B>OS/2 Developer's Toolkit</B> for
all the SOM header files and the SOM compiler.

<!-- V1.0.6: updated and extended this item -->
<P>It is recommended to use the <B>Warp 4.5 toolkit</B>. Since compatibility
with Warp 3 was given up with XWorkplace 1.0.1, there is no requirement to
use the Warp 3 toolkit anymore. Unfortunately, most versions of the Warp 4.5
toolkit have a broken SOM compiler, <CODE>nmake.exe</CODE>, and <CODE>rc.exe</CODE>.

<P>To solve this problem, you can either use the toolkit that comes with
eComStation 1.2R and later, or use the following work-around:

<P><UL><LI><B>Either...</B> copy the emitter DLLs from the Warp 4 toolkit,
<B>except for <CODE>EMITIR.DLL</CODE></B>. See the <CODE>EMIT*.DLL</CODE>
files in the <CODE>SOM\LIB\</CODE> subdirectory of the toolkit.

<!-- V1.0.9 [rw]: added this paragraph -->
<P><LI><B>Or...</B> change the <CODE>SMBASE</CODE> variable in
<A HREF="src1_32env.html">config.in</A>
to point to a directory containing an earlier version of the SOM compiler.

<P><LI>Copy <CODE>nmake.exe</CODE> from the Warp 3 toolkit, or use the one from VAC++.

<P><LI>Use the version of <CODE>rc.exe</CODE> that comes with OS/2 and eComStation.
</UL>

<LI><B>IBM NMAKE</B> is our make utility. This comes with VAC, so no problem there.

<P><LI>You will also need to check out the <B>"xwphelpers" CVS archive</B> from Netlabs.
It contains code which is shared by both XWorkplace and WarpIN.  Note: you don't need
the WarpIN sources to compile XWorkplace, only "xwphelpers".

<P><LI>Only if you enable debugging code through <CODE>XWP_DEBUG</CODE>
in <A HREF="src1_32env.html">config.in</A>,
you will need the full <B>PMPRINTF package by Dennis Bareis.</B>

<P>Check the <A HREF="src1_880debug.html">"Debugging"</A> section for details.
