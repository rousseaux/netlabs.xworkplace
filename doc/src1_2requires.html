<OL><LI><B>Compiler.</B> With V0.80, I have switched to <B>IBM VisualAge C++ 3.0</B>
to develop XWorkplace. For VAC++ 3.0, <B>fixpak 8</B> is strongly recommended,
because the original crashes frequently with the complex SOM header files.

<P>Other compilers are presently not supported.

<P><LI>You need some <B>OS/2 Developer's Toolkit</B> for
all the SOM header files and the SOM compiler.
<P>The <B>Warp 3 toolkit</B> is sufficient. XWorkplace does some tricks for Warp 4 too,
but does it even though I don't have the Warp 4 toolkit. <CODE>;-)</CODE>

<P><LI><B>IBM NMAKE</B> is our make utily. This comes with VAC, so no problem there.

<P><LI>You need to check out the <B>"xwphelpers" CVS archive</B> from Netlabs also.
XWorkplace uses a lot
of code which is shared between WarpIN and XWorkplace, which has been separated
into a new CVS archive.
(Starting with V0.9.6, the WarpIN sources are no longer needed.)
There's no way to compile without that
code.

<P><LI>Only if you enable debugging code through <CODE>XWP_DEBUG</CODE>
in <A HREF="src1_32env.html">config.in</A>,
you will need the full <B>PMPRINTF package by Dennis Bareis.</B>

<P>Check the <A HREF="src1_880debug.html">"Debugging"</A> section for details.
