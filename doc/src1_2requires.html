<UL><LI><B>Compiler.</B> With V0.80, I have switched to IBM VisualAge C++ 3.0
to develop XWorkplace.
I have not tried EMX/GCC because I'm too lazy to get used to it, even
though it might compile faster.
<P>For VAC++ 3.0, fixpak 8 is strongly recommended, because the original crashes
frequently with the complex SOM header files.
<P>I'm not perfectly sure whether I'm using IBM-specific language extensions.
I had to switch the language level to &quot;extended&quot; to use some none-POSIX
C stuff, and I'm not sure whether this is working with GCC. I have looked up some
functions in the EMX docs, such as <CODE>_beginthread</CODE>, and these appear to
be the same, even though they're not POSIX C.
<P>If you get these sources compiled with a different compiler, please let me
know or supply patches.

<P><LI>Whatever compiler you use, you need some <B>OS/2 Developer's Toolkit</B> for
all the SOM header files.
<P>The Warp 3 toolkit is sufficient. XWorkplace does some tricks for Warp 4 too,
but does it even though I don't have the Warp 4 toolkit. <CODE>;-)</CODE>
The Toolkit is also needed for changing
<A HREF="040nls.html">NLS files,</A> even though you won't
need a compiler for that.

<P><LI>You need an "installation directory" of XWorkplace because the makefiles
copy all output files to that directory tree. This directory tree must be specified
using the <CODE>XWPRUNNING</CODE> <A HREF="src1_32env.html">environment variable</A>.

<P><LI>All the .C files have lots of debugging code which can conditionally be
compiled using certain #define's in <CODE>include\setup.h</CODE>. That file
is <CODE>#include</CODE>'d from all XWorkplace source files.
<P>Only if you enable the debugging code,
you need the full <B>PMPRINTF package by Dennis Bareis.</B>
You do <I>not</I> need that package if you don't uncomment the debugging #define's
in that file.
<P>Per default, those #define's are commented out, so don't worry.
Check the <A HREF="src1_880debug.html">"Debugging"</A> section.

</UL>Also see the <A HREF="src1_31make.html">"Making XWorkplace"</A> section for how to
rebuild XWorkplace.
