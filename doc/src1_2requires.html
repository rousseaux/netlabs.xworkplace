<UL><LI><B>Compiler.</B> With V0.80, I have switched to IBM VisualAge C++ 3.0
to develop XWorkplace.
I have not adjusted the code to work with EMX/GCC yet. We did this for the
WarpIN sources, and this is turns out to be a constant hassle. If you care
to make the code work with EMX, go ahead...
<P>For VAC++ 3.0, <B>fixpak 8</B> is strongly recommended, because the original crashes
frequently with the complex SOM header files.
<P>I'm not perfectly sure whether I'm using IBM-specific language extensions.
I had to switch the language level to &quot;extended&quot; to use some none-POSIX
C stuff, and I'm not sure whether this is working with GCC. I have looked up some
functions in the EMX docs, such as <CODE>_beginthread</CODE>, and these appear to
be the same, even though they're not POSIX C.
<P>If you get these sources compiled with a different compiler, please let me
know or supply patches.

<P><LI>Whatever compiler you use, you need some <B>OS/2 Developer's Toolkit</B> for
all the SOM header files and the SOM compiler.
(Those are <I>not</I> included with EMX, so even with
EMX, you'll need the toolkit headers).
<P>The Warp 3 toolkit is sufficient. XWorkplace does some tricks for Warp 4 too,
but does it even though I don't have the Warp 4 toolkit. <CODE>;-)</CODE>

<P><LI>You need the <B>WarpIN source code</B> also because XWorkplace uses a lot
of shared code from that package as well. There's no way to compile without that
code, so download the most current WarpIN source package as well (or check it out
from the CVS tree).

<P><LI>All the .C files have lots of debugging code which can conditionally be
compiled using certain #define's in <CODE>include\setup.h</CODE>. That file
is <CODE>#include</CODE>'d from all XWorkplace source files.
<P>Only if you enable the debugging code,
you need the full <B>PMPRINTF package by Dennis Bareis.</B>
You do <I>not</I> need that package if you don't uncomment the debugging #define's
in that file.
<P>Per default, those #define's are commented out, so don't worry.
Check the <A HREF="src1_880debug.html">"Debugging"</A> section.

</UL>Also see the <A HREF="src1_31make.html">"Making XWorkplace"</A> section for how to
rebuild XWorkplace.
