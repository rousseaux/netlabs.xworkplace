<UL><LI><B>Compiler.</B> With V0.80, I have switched to
<B>IBM VisualAge C++ 3.0</B>
to develop XWorkplace. For VAC++ 3.0, <B>fixpak 8</B> is strongly recommended,
because the original crashes frequently with the complex SOM header files.
<P>I have not adjusted the code to work with EMX/GCC or Watcom. We did this for the
WarpIN sources and EMX, and this is turns out to be a constant hassle. If you care
to make the code work other compilers, go ahead...
<P>I'm not perfectly sure whether I'm using IBM-specific language extensions.
I had to switch the language level to &quot;extended&quot; to use some none-POSIX
C stuff, and I'm not sure whether this is working with GCC. I have looked up some
functions in the EMX docs, such as <CODE>_beginthread</CODE>, and these appear to
be the same, even though they're not POSIX C.
<P>If you get these sources compiled with a different compiler, please let me
know or supply patches.

<P><LI>Whatever compiler you use, you need some <B>OS/2 Developer's Toolkit</B> for
all the SOM header files and the SOM compiler.
(Those are <I>not</I> included with EMX, so even with
EMX, you'll need the toolkit headers).
<P>The <B>Warp 3 toolkit</B> is sufficient. XWorkplace does some tricks for Warp 4 too,
but does it even though I don't have the Warp 4 toolkit. <CODE>;-)</CODE>

<P><LI><B>IBM NMAKE</B> is our make utily.
NMAKE comes with the IBM compilers (and therefore with VAC also) and is now also publicly
available with the IBM Device Driver Development Kit (DDK),
available from <A HREF="http://service.boulder.ibm.com/ddk/">http://service.boulder.ibm.com/ddk/</A>.
It's behind the "Build tools ZIP file" button (tools.zip).
You will need to register first, but other than that, the
thing is free.

<P><LI>You need to check out the <B>"xwphelpers" CVS archive</B> from Netlabs also.
XWorkplace uses a lot
of code which is shared between WarpIN and XWorkplace, which has been separated
into a new CVS archive.
(Starting with V0.9.6, the WarpIN sources are no longer needed.)
There's no way to compile without that
code.

<P><LI>Only if you enable debugging code by setting the <CODE>XWP_DEBUG</CODE>
<A HREF="src1_32env.html">environment variable</A>,
you need the full <B>PMPRINTF package by Dennis Bareis.</B>
<P>
Check the <A HREF="src1_880debug.html">"Debugging"</A> section for details.

<P><LI>Only if you want to build the ring-0 security driver (<CODE>XWPSEC32.SYS</CODE>) for
<A HREF="src2_860xwpsec.html">XWorkplace Security</A>, you will need
<B>ALP, the IBM assembler.</B>
XWPSecurity is only built if the respective
<A HREF="src1_32env.html">environment variable</A> is set.
<P>ALP is in the Warp 4 toolkit and in the DDK (I think).
From my testing, only ALP 4.00.001 was able to swallow
the assembler files. I tested with 4.00.006, and it refused to accept
some of the constructs in there. I am no assembler freak, so
maybe someone else can help.
