<OL><LI>If you get errors from the <B>makefiles,</B> make sure you have set up the
<A HREF="src1_32env.html">environment variables</A> right.

<P><LI>Also, you need to check out the "xwphelpers" CVS archive from Netlabs for the
<A HREF="src1_5helpers.html">helpers</A> code. Make sure that this code
is not outdated, and that the environment variables are set correctly.

<P><LI>If you get something like <B>"File XWPDAEMN.EXE/XWPHOOK.DLL is in use",</B> the
XWorkplace hook DLL is currently loaded and running. While all other executables
are automatically unlocked and replaced by the makefiles even while they're running,
this cannot be done with the daemon, which is using the XWorkplace hook DLL,
because then you'd only be able to reload
that DLL by rebooting (it will _never_ get released otherwise).

<P>Use WatchCat or some other process killer to kill <CODE>XWPDAEMN.EXE</CODE>, which
will automatically unload the hook DLL. Then, after the build, restart the daemon
by executing <CODE>XWPDAEMN -D</CODE> (to circumvent the error message box which
comes up otherwise).

<P>Warning: If you don't restart the daemon before restarting the WPS, the XWorkplace
startup folder will get processed again after the WPS restart.

<P><LI>If you get unknown definitions or unresolved externals during compiling/linking,
make sure that the "xwphelpers" and XWorkplace sources have the same code levels. I tend
to change the <A HREF="src1_5helpers.html">helpers</A> code from time to time.

<P><LI>If you get really strange compilation errors, VAC might have gotten confused
with precompiled headers. Delete all <CODE>.PCH</CODE> files in your TEMP directory,
or comment out the <CODE>PRECH</CODE> line in <CODE>setup.in</CODE> to disable
precompiled headers altogether. I have also found that killing <CODE>DDE4LOAD.EXE</CODE>
(the VAC background process) helps sometimes, for whatever reason.

<P><LI>If you <B>cannot install XWorkplace</B> after the build, you have probably built
the debug version, but the PMPRINTF DLLs are not on your LIBPATH.
<B>Do not build the debug version if you haven't downloaded PMPRINTF yet.</B>
See <A HREF="src1_880debug.html">"Debugging"</A> for details.
