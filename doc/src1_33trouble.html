<OL><LI>If you get errors from the <B>makefiles,</B> make sure you have set up
<A HREF="src1_32env.html">config.in</A> correctly.

<P><LI>Same thing if the compiler cannot find an include file, or the linker
cannot find libraries.

<P><LI>Also, you need to check out the "xwphelpers" CVS archive from Netlabs for the
<A HREF="src1_5helpers.html">helpers</A> code. Make sure that this code
is not outdated (I usually update it together with the main XWorkplace code).

<P>Same thing if you get unknown definitions or unresolved externals during
compiling/linking. This is most probably due to outdated helpers.

<P><LI>If you get unresolved externals while linking the XCenter widgets, take
a look at <CODE>src\shared\xwp.def</CODE>, which exports the functions from
XFLDR.DLL.

<P><LI>If you get something like <B>"File XWPDAEMN.EXE/XWPHOOK.DLL is in use",</B>
use WatchCat or some other process killer to kill <CODE>XWPDAEMN.EXE</CODE>, which
will automatically unload the hook DLL. Then, after the build, restart the daemon
by executing <CODE>XWPDAEMN -D</CODE> (to circumvent the error message box which
comes up otherwise).

<P>See <A HREF="src1_32env.html">config.in</A> for details.

<P><LI>If you get really strange compilation errors, VAC might have gotten confused
with precompiled headers. Delete all <CODE>.PCH</CODE> files in your TEMP directory,
or comment out the <CODE>PRECH</CODE> line in <CODE>setup.in</CODE> to disable
precompiled headers altogether. I have also found that killing <CODE>DDE4LOAD.EXE</CODE>
(the VAC background process) helps sometimes, for whatever reason.

<P><LI>If you <B>cannot install XWorkplace</B> after the build, you have probably built
the debug version, but the PMPRINTF DLLs are not on your LIBPATH.
<B>Do not build the debug version if you haven't downloaded PMPRINTF yet.</B>
See <A HREF="src1_880debug.html">"Debugging"</A> for details.
