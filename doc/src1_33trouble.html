<OL><LI>If you get errors from the <B>makefiles,</B> make sure you have set up the
<A HREF="src1_32env.html">environment variables</A> right.

<P><LI>Also, you need to check out the WarpIN source tree for the
<A HREF="src1_5helpers.html">helpers</A> code.

<P><LI>If you get something like <B>"File XWPHOOK.DLL is in use",</B> the
XWorkplace hook DLL is currently loaded and running. While all other executables
are automatically unlocked and replaced by the makefiles even while they're running,
this cannot be done with the hook DLL, because then you'd only be able to reload
that DLL by rebooting (it will _never_ get released otherwise).

<P>Use WatchCat or some other process killer to kill <CODE>XWPDAEMN.EXE</CODE>, which
will automatically unload the hook DLL. Then, after the build, restart the daemon
by executing <CODE>XWPDAEMN -D</CODE> (to circumvent the error message box which
comes up otherwise).

<P>Warning: If you don't restart the daemon before restarting the WPS, the XWorkplace
startup folder will get processed again after the WPS restart.

<P><LI>If you <B>cannot install XWorkplace</B> after the build, you have probably built
the debug version, but the PMPRINTF DLLs are not on your LIBPATH. See
<A HREF="src1_880debug.html">"Debugging"</A> for details.
