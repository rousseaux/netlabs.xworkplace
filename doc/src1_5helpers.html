<CODE>SRC\HELPERS</CODE> contains lots of useful code which I have developed
over time. This code is <B>independent of XWorkplace</B> and could be used
with any OS/2 program. Some of the code is for PM programs, some can be used
with text-mode programs also. Consider this a general OS/2 programming
library.

<P><B>Note:</B> XWorkplace's source code does not contain the helpers source code.
Instead, during the build process, the XWorkplace makefiles branch over to the
"xwphelpers" source tree, which is also on the Netlabs CVS server. You will need to
set the <CODE>HELPERS_BASE</CODE> <A HREF="src1_32env.html">environment variable</A>
to point to the "xwphelpers" source tree for this to work.

<P> In detail, we have:
