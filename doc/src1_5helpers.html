<CODE>SRC\HELPERS</CODE> contains lots of useful code which I have developed
over time. This code is <B>independent of XWorkplace</B> and could be used
with any OS/2 program. Some of the code is for PM programs, some can be used
with text-mode programs also. Consider this a general OS/2 programming
library.

<P><B>Note:</B> XWorkplace's source code does not contain the helpers source code.
Instead, during the build process, the XWorkplace makefiles branch over to the
WarpIN source tree, which is also on the Netlabs CVS server. You will need to
set the <CODE>HELPERS_BASE</CODE> <A HREF="src1_32env.html">environment variable</A>
to point to the WarpIN source tree for this to work.

<P> In detail, we have:
<UL>
<LI>
<CODE>animate.*</CODE> contains some animation code.

<LI>
<CODE>cnrh.*</CODE> Container helper functions (new with V0.9.0,
partly moved from winh.*).

<LI>
<CODE>comctl.*</CODE> Various window procedures.

<LI>
<CODE>debug.*</CODE> parses executables and SYM files for debugging
information; used by except.c (below). Introduced with V0.84,
moved to <CODE>SRC\HELPERS\</CODE> with V0.9.0.

<CODE>dosh.*</CODE> Control Program helper functions.

<LI>
<CODE>eas.*</CODE> contains helper functions to handle
extended attributes.

<P><LI>
<CODE>except.*</CODE> contains generic code for implementing powerful
exception handlers. This was introduced with V0.84 and has been moved
to <CODE>SRC\HELPERS\</CODE> with V0.9.0. The code has been straightened
out to be independent of XWorkplace with the use of exception "plug-ins".
See <A HREF="src2_840except.html">"XWorkplace exception handling"</A> for details.
