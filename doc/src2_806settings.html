XWorkplace uses two kinds of settings: global and instance settings.
<P>
The <B>global settings</B> are set both in the &quot;Workplace Shell&quot; object and
on the &quot;XDesktop&quot; notebook page and are stored in the &quot;XWorkplace&quot; app
in <CODE>OS2.INI</CODE>. All the global notebook logic is in <CODE>xfsys.c</CODE>.
<P>
XWorkplace's code accesses these settings via a large structure called
<CODE>GLOBALSETTINGS</CODE> (suprise!) defined in <CODE>common.h</CODE>, to which a pointer be
obtained using <CODE>cmnQueryGlobalSettings</CODE> (<CODE>common.c</CODE>).
<P>
By contrast, the <B>individual object settings</B> are stored in
instance data, which is declared in the <CODE>.IDL</CODE> files. Most of these are
stored and retrieved using the normal WPS mechanism
(<CODE>wpSaveDeferred</CODE>/<CODE>wpRestoreData</CODE>) and can have
a certain &quot;transparent&quot;
value, which means that the global setting is to be used instead.
