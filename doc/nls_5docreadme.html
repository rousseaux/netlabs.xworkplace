<!-- V1.0.6: added this file -->
There are two README files that need to be translated:

<UL><LI><CODE>README</CODE> is the main README file for XWorkplace and
contains information regarding installation requirements, updating,
NLS, and feedback. This file is displayed during installation of
the XWorkplace base package.

<P>Since this is a plain text file, you have to take care of any
formatting yourself. Also rename the translated file to whatever
"read me" means in your language, e.g., "leggimi" in Italian or
"liesmich" in German.

<P><LI><CODE>README.NLS</CODE> should contain information about the
specific NLS package only. A suitable table of contents could consist of:
introduction, requirements, installation, known problems and limitations,
source code, license, contact, credits.

<P>Since this is a plain text file, you have to take care of any
formatting yourself. Also rename the translated file to whatever
"read me" means in your language, e.g., "leggimi.nls" in Italian or
"liesmich.nls" in German.
</UL>

<P>Please tell the maintainers about the translated file names so
the WarpIN script for the base package can be updated with those.
