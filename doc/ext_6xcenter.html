You can write independent plug-in DLLs for the XCenter to implement XCenter widget
classes. This saves you from dealing with all the WPS programming details and even
from having to compile the rest of XWorkplace.

<P>Detailed documentation for writing plug-in DLLs has been added to the
<I>XWorkplace User Guide</I> with V0.9.9. Please see that documentation for
details.

<P>Still, since you have obviously downloaded the XWorkplace source code,
if you are interested, I strongly suggest that you create the XWorkplace
<A HREF="src1_4docs.html">code documentation</A>. Then, in the HTML files which
are generated, look for the documentation for <CODE>src\shared\center.c</CODE>
documentation which gives you plenty of introductory information.

<P>Several standard XCenter widgets have been created as plugin DLLs to show you
how this can be done. Their sources are in the <CODE>src\widgets</CODE> directory.
In that directory, you will also find <CODE>____sample.c</CODE>, which you can
use as a template for your own widgets.
