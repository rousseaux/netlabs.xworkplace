You can write independent plug-in DLLs for the XCenter to implement XCenter widget
classes. This saves you from dealing with all the WPS programming details and even
from having to compile the rest of XWorkplace.

<P>The XCenter checks for plugin DLLs in the <CODE>plugins\xcenter</CODE> subdirectory
of its installation directory. Any DLL in that directory is considered an XCenter
widget plugin DLL.

<P>Writing such a DLL basically boils down to writing a PM window class (with a few
extra rules to follow to communicate with the XCenter) and exporting a couple of
functions from the DLL so that the XCenter can know about your widget class.

<P>Again, this requires no knowledge about WPS programming. You don't even have to
compile the rest of XWorkplace to write such a DLL. If you know PM programming,
you can write a widget plugin DLL.

<P>If you are interested, I strongly suggest that you create the XWorkplace
<A HREF="src1_4docs.html">code documentation</A>. Then, in the HTML files which
are generated, look for the documentation for <CODE>src\shared\center.c</CODE>
documentation which gives you plenty of introductory information.

<P>Several standard XCenter widgets have been created as plugin DLLs to show you
how this can be done. Their sources are in the <CODE>src\widgets</CODE> directory.
In that directory, you will also find <CODE>____sample.c</CODE>, which you can
use as a template for your own widgets.
