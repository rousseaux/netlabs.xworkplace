Even though all
the source files in this package can be edited using any editor (because
they're all plain text files), you will need some extra utilities to create
the actual NLS files.
<P>
<B>In any case, a C compiler is</B> <I>not</I> <B>required</B>.
<P>
To be more precise:

<UL><LI>I have written my own utility which converts the HTML sources for
the INF and HLP files to IPF format for IPFC (see below). This is in the
<CODE>xwphelpers</CODE> repository on Netlabs, so in addition to the
XWorkplace sources, you will need to check out <CODE>xwphelpers</CODE>
as well. The utility is called <CODE>h2i.exe</CODE> and gets called
automatically by the makefiles.

<P><LI>The makefiles also convert the GIF files for the INF and HLP files
to BMP format automatically. For this to work, you will need the
&quot;Generalized Bitmap Module&quot; (GBM) package from Hobbes.
The makefiles assume that <CODE>gbmsize.exe</CODE> is on your PATH.

<P><LI>In order to create INF and HLP
files, you need IBM's "Information Presentation Facility Compiler" (<CODE>IPFC.EXE</CODE>).
This thing is part of the OS/2 Developer's Toolkit, which is finally
included with eComStation and the IBM Convenience Packs.

<P>If you don't have the Toolkit, IPFC is contained in the
<B>Device Driver Development Kit (DDK)</B>, which IBM has put online at
<A HREF="http://service.boulder.ibm.com/dl/ddk/priv/ddk-d">http://service.boulder.ibm.com/dl/ddk/priv/ddk-d</A>.
You will need to register, but then downloads are free. Download <CODE>combase.zip</CODE>,
which has IPFC plus a number of other tools. (Note: I was reportes that apparently
this is now in <CODE>tools.zip</CODE>.) After unpacking, IPFC is in the
<CODE>DDK\base\tools</CODE> directory, which you should include in your PATH.

<P><LI>The makefiles in this package were written for <B>IBM NMAKE,</B> which comes
with all the IBM compilers (and also with the DDK mentioned above).
I'm not sure these will work with other MAKE utilities, such as
DMAKE or GNU make. I'd be grateful for feedback.
<P>The makefiles are only for conveniently updating the target NLS files.
If you don't have NMAKE, you can still assemble the files manually. See the
following pages for details.

<P><LI>XWorkplace V0.9.0 and above can read the TMF message file directly,
so <CODE>MKMSGF.EXE</CODE> is no longer needed to compile message files.
