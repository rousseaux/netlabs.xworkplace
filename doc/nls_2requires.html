Even though all
the source files in this package can be edited using any editor (because
they're all plain text files), you will need some extra utilities to create
the actual NLS files.
<P>
<B>In any case, a C compiler is</B> <I>not</I> <B>required</B>.
<P>
To be more precise:

<UL><LI>In order to create <CODE>.INF</CODE> and <CODE>.HLP</CODE>
files, you need IBM's "Information Presentation Facility Compiler" (<CODE>IPFC.EXE</CODE>).
This thing is part of the OS/2 Developer's Toolkit, which, unfortunately, still
isn't free. <I>However,</I> I have now found that IPFC is contained in the
<B>Device Driver Development Kit (DDK)</B>, which IBM has put online at
<A HREF="http://service.boulder.ibm.com/dl/ddk/priv/ddk-d">http://service.boulder.ibm.com/dl/ddk/priv/ddk-d</A>.
You will need to register, but then downloads are free. Download <CODE>combase.zip</CODE>,
which has IPFC plus a number of other tools. After unpacking, IPFC is in the
<CODE>DDK\base\tools</CODE> directory, which you should include in your PATH.

<P><LI>The makefiles in this package were written for <B>IBM NMAKE,</B> which comes
with all the IBM compilers (and also with the DDK mentioned above).
I'm not sure these will work with other MAKE utilities, such as
DMAKE or GNU make. I'd be grateful for feedback.
<P>The makefiles are only for conveniently updating the target NLS files.
If you don't have NMAKE, you can still assemble the files manually. See the
following pages for details.

<P><LI>XWorkplace V0.9.0 no longer uses OS/2 message files (those <CODE>.MSG</CODE>
things). Instead, we have developed a new format which uses plain text ASCII
files (with a <CODE>.TMF</CODE> extension) as input, so <CODE>MKMSGF.EXE</CODE>
is no longer needed to compile message files.
