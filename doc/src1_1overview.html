Before going into the details of source code, which is complex enough to get
even the more experienced programmer confused,
<B>please read the chapters in the &quot;XWorkplace internals&quot; chapter
of the XWorkplace Online reference</B> for a first introduction to XWorkplace's basic
inner workings.
<P>This will give you a vague idea of what XWorkplace is doing where
and deals with the most important concepts only, so you don't get
overwhelmed by all the details which come in this file.
<P>
The different <B>subdirectories</B> contain the different parts of XWorkplace.
The layout of the subdirectories has been changed with XWorkplace V0.9.0 to
allow for easier addition of new features by people other than me. Also,
since XWorkplace will be on the Netlabs CVS server, many changes had to be
made to the makefiles and code layout.
<UL><LI>
The <CODE>001\</CODE> directory tree still contains all the
<A HREF="040nls.html">National Language Support (NLS)</A>
for English.

<P><LI>The <CODE>BIN\</CODE> directory contains binary object files which
are created from the sources (below) by the various makefiles. If that
directory doesn't exist (it's not part of the CVS tree, for many reasons),
it will be created automatically by the makefiles.

<P><LI>The <CODE>IDL\</CODE> directory contains SOM IDL source files for
the various XWorkplace classes. The <CODE>.DEF</CODE> files in this
directory are created automatically by the SOM compiler (<CODE>SC.EXE</CODE>),
but not used in the build process (see below). When invoked by the
makefile, the SOM compiler is told to update the sources in <CODE>SRC\CLASSES</CODE>
and write the class header files to <CODE>INCLUDE\CLASSES</CODE>.
<P>In general, all SOM code must be in the <CODE>CLASSES</CODE> subdirectories.
Since several people might be working on the same classes (one example is the
XWPMouse class, which is used for both the XWorkplace hook and the animated
mouse pointers), the code in <CODE>CLASSES</CODE> should only call implementation
code in other directories of <CODE>SRC</CODE>, which should be prototyped in
a corresponding subdirectory of <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE>.

<P><LI>The <CODE>INCLUDE\</CODE> directory tree has all the headers for
XWorkplace.
<P>In that tree, <CODE>INCLUDE\CLASSES\</CODE> has the headers which are
generated by the SOM compiler from the IDL files in the <CODE>IDL</CODE>
directory (above).
<P><CODE>INCLUDE\HELPERS\</CODE> has the headers for the files in <CODE>SRC\HELPERS\</CODE>
(see below).
<P><CODE>INCLUDE\FILESYS\</CODE> has the headers for the files in <CODE>SRC\FILESYS\</CODE>
(see below).
<P><CODE>INCLUDE\SHARED\</CODE> has headers for code which might be used by several
parts of XWorkplace, developed by several people, and corresponds to
<CODE>SRC\SHARED</CODE>. I guess you get the idea now.

<P><LI>The <CODE>SRC\</CODE> directory tree contains the actual C/CPP source
files for XWorkplace.
<P>In that tree, <CODE>SRC\CLASSES\</CODE> has
the SOM code for the WPS classes which will be compiled into <CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE>.
It is this DLL which loads the NLS DLL
(<CODE>XFLDRxxx.DLL</CODE>, with xxx being a language code) at WPS bootup
or when the language is changed using the &quot;XWorkplace Internals&quot;
settings page. See <A HREF="src1_4maindll.html">this page</A> for more.
<P>The <CODE>SRC\HELPERS\</CODE> subdirectory contains a lot of C files with
helper functions which are independent of XWorkplace. That is, these can be used with
any OS/2 VIO and/or PM program. The functions are grouped into categories.
See <A HREF="src1_5helpers.html">this page</A> for more.
<P>The <CODE>SRC\HELPERS\</CODE> dir also contains files from Dennis Bareis' PMPRINTF package,
which is available in full from his homepage. Refer to the
<A HREF="src1_880debug.html">"Debugging XWorkplace"</A> section
for details.
<P>The other subdirectories in <CODE>SRC\</CODE> contain implementation code for
<CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE> (called by the SOM code in <CODE>SRC\CLASSES</CODE>)
or external programs which are part of XWorkplace, such as NetscapeDDE and Treesize.

<P><LI><CODE>TOOLS\</CODE> contains some tools used by the makefiles.
See <A HREF="src1_31make.html">Making XWorkplace</A>.
