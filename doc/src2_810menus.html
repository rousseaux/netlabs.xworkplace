This is perhaps the most complex part of XWorkplace. After all, this is
what I've started with, so some code parts may well be unchanged
since December '97, when I neither knew much about C nor about WPS
programming.
<P>
With V0.81, all the logic for manipulating and evaluating context
menus has been moved to a new file, <CODE>menus.c</CODE>. All these functions have
been given the <CODE>mnu*</CODE> prefix to make this a bit clearer.
<P>
The XWorkplace classes override <CODE>wpModifyPopupMenu</CODE> and
<CODE>wpMenuItem[Help]Selected</CODE> for almost every replacement class. These
overrides either handle the new context menu items in that method
code or, for XFolder and XFldDisk, call the functions in <CODE>menus.c</CODE>,
because these two classes share many common menu items, so we can
share most of the code also.
<P>
All newly inserted menu items use <I>variable</I> menu IDs. You can tell
this from their #define names, which have an <CODE>_OFS_</CODE> in their name
(check <CODE>dlgids.h</CODE>). To all these values, XWorkplace adds the offset that
is specified on the &quot;Paranoia&quot; notebook page.
<P>
For an introduction to how the config folder menu items work, see the
"XWorkplace Internals" section in the
<I>XWorkplace User Guide</I>.
XWorkplace uses a fairly obscure system of global
variables to be able to relate menu items to their intended
functions. All the variable menu items are stored in a global linked
list when the context menu is opened for a folder. In each list item,
XWorkplace also stores what kind of object (template, program object,
folder content item etc.) the menu item represents. This list is then
examined by <CODE>wpMenuItemSelected</CODE> to perform the corresponding action
(create a new object, start program etc.). After that, the list is
destroyed, so it only eats up memory while the context menu is open.
All this code is now (V0.81) in <CODE>menus.c</CODE>.
<P>
As opposed to the "regular" new menu items,
the <B>folder content menus</B> are initially only inserted as empty submenu stubs.
They are only filled with items when they're opened: XWorkplace
intercepts <CODE>WM_INITMENU</CODE> in the subclassed folder frame proc
(<CODE>fnwpSubclassedFolderFrame</CODE>, <CODE>src\filesys\folder.c</CODE>) and then
populates the menu.
These menu items are stored in the global list too and marked as
folder content menu items so that <CODE>wpMenuItemSelected</CODE> will then simply
open the corresponding WPS object. The folder content code has now
been moved to <CODE>menus.c</CODE> also.
<P>
Painting the icons is then done using owner-draw menu items; the
messages which are necessary for this are also intercepted in
<CODE>fnwpSubclassedFolderFrame</CODE> and then call corresponding functions in
<CODE>menus.c</CODE>.
<P>
The folder content <I>menu windows</I> are also subclassed to be able to intercept
right-mouse button clicks. The new window proc for this is called
(suprise!) <CODE>fnwpFolderContentMenu</CODE>.
<P>
The <CODE>xfSelectingMenuItem</CODE> method introduced in V0.80 has been removed
again with V0.81 due to the problems with SOM multiple inheritance.
