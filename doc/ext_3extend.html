This section describes what to do if the class that you need already exists in
XWorkplace. Of course, this requires less setup work, because much of the work
has already been done.

<OL><LI>If you need a new WPS method which isn't overridden yet, modify the
IDL file in <CODE>IDL\</CODE> to suit your needs. Please, please, if you modify
my IDL files, follow the coding style which exists, especially those "@@" flags etc.,
which are needed for <A HREF="src1_4docs.html">code documentation</A> to work.

<P>If the method you need is already overridden by XWorkplace, go to <B>3.</B>

<P><LI>If you then re-make XWorkplace, the SOM compiler will automatically get invoked
and modify the sources in <CODE>SRC\CLASSES</CODE> and the headers in
<CODE>INCLUDE\CLASSES</CODE> accordingly.

<P><LI>Again, as said on the <A HREF="ext_2addclass.html">previous page</A>, add your own
directory to <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE> and <CODE>SRC</CODE>. Modify the SOM code of the
class you need in <CODE>SRC\CLASSES</CODE> to call your implementation in your
<CODE>SRC\YOURDIR</CODE> directory.

<P><LI>You will need to add your header from <CODE>INCLUDE\YOURDIR</CODE> to the
SOM class code file that you modified. Please think of some useful
<A HREF="src1_801prefixes.html">function prefix</A> for your exported functions so
that other programmers (including me) can find your code more easily.

<P>Don't forget to update <CODE>src\classes\makefile</CODE> so that the class code
file will be made dependent on your header.

<P><LI>In <CODE>SRC\YOURDIR\</CODE>, write your own makefile which compiles your
sources. You can take the makefile in <CODE>SRC\FILESYS\</CODE> as a template. This
makefile is pretty smart because it automatically recognizes whether it is called
from the main makefile, and if not, it invokes the main makefile, which in turn
will call the sub-makefiles later. Also, that makefile uses the general makefile
include <CODE>setup.in</CODE> in the main directory for compiler setup etc.

<P>Make sure that your makefile writes all <CODE>.OBJ</CODE> files into the
<CODE>BIN</CODE> directory, which your makefile must create if it doesn't exist yet.
Again, see how the makefile in <CODE>SRC\FILESYS</CODE> does this.

<P>Other than that, in <CODE>SRC\YOURDIR</CODE>, do whatever you want.

<P><LI>Finally, take a look at <CODE>\makefile</CODE>. This is the "master makefile"
which links all .OBJ modules into the main XWorkplace DLL (<CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE>).
In that makefile, there is an <CODE>OBJS</CODE> macro which lists all the .OBJ files
which are to be linked together.
<P>Add your .OBJ file(s) to the end of that variable (and please, add a comment that
you did so).
