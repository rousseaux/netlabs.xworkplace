<P>
The <CODE>MISC</CODE> directory contains files used by XWorkplace's installation script
(INSTALL.CMD) plus the SmartGuide Script used for the XWorkplace
introduction.


<UL>
  <LI>
<CODE>INSTxxx.MSG</CODE> (with &quot;xxx&quot; being your country code, which you need to
change) is -- I'm sorry -- in a proprietary format. It's not difficult
to understand though: The file is used by <CODE>XHELP.CMD</CODE> (in the XWorkplace
package), which is capable of extracting single text messages in
between the <CODE>&lt;TOPIC&gt;</CODE>; and <CODE>&lt;/TOPIC&gt;</CODE>
tags in this file. The text
between these tags is then displayed on the screen.
<P>
<B>Please note that this file will disappear in a future release of XWorkplace, as soon
as the WarpIn installer is functioning, which I am currently working on. See my WWW
homepage for details.</B>
<P>
If you still wish to translate this file,
what you need to do here is simply translate all the text which follows
a <CODE>&lt;TOPIC&gt;</CODE> tag. The text is displayed &quot;as is&quot;,
and no formatting is
performed; as a result, you must take care that no more than 80
characters are contained in a line.
<P>
You also should take care of the line breaks: it makes a difference
in output whether a <CODE>&lt;/TOPIC&gt;</CODE> end tag is found at the end of a line
or at the beginning of a new line, because in the latter case, the
line break is still printed to the screen.
<P>
Just one more note: Do not change the keys mentioned in this file
(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;N&quot;), even if your language
does not use &quot;Y&quot; for saying
&quot;Yes&quot;. Unfortunately, <CODE>INSTALL.CMD</CODE> relies on these keys. <CODE>:-(</CODE>


<P><LI>
<CODE>CROBJxxx.CMD</CODE> is a straightforward REXX script which creates the
default XWorkplace Configuration Folder. Even if you don't know REXX,
don't worry: you only have to change the strings on top of the file,
which contain all the language-dependent things. Be careful with the quotes.
Do not change anything else, because XWorkplace relies on it.


<P><LI>
<CODE>SOUNDxxx.CMD</CODE> is the REXX script which creates the neccessary INI
entries for having the new XWorkplace system sounds in your &quot;Sound&quot;
object. Only change the strings at the top of the file to your language.


<P><LI>
<CODE>XFLDRxxx.SGS</CODE> is a Warp 4 SmartGuide script to display the &quot;Welcome&quot;
window after XWorkplace has been installed and the WPS has been restarted.
<P>I have no idea what the precise syntax for these files is (once again
has IBM developed good software, but then lets it rot), but it seems
to be some HTML-like syntax, except that <B>the tags MUST be in
lower case,</B> or they won't work.
