<P>
The <CODE>MISC</CODE> directory contains files used by XWorkplace's installation script
(INSTALL.CMD) plus the SmartGuide Script used for the XWorkplace
introduction.


<UL>
  <LI>
<CODE>INSTxxx.MSG</CODE> (with &quot;xxx&quot; being your country code)
was used for installation messages before the WarpIN installer was used.
Even though the old <CODE>INSTALL.CMD</CODE> still works for XWorkplace,
<B>it really doesn't make much sense to translate this message file any more.</B>

<P>The file was used by <CODE>XHELP.CMD</CODE> (in the XWorkplace
package, taken from my CommandPak), which is capable of extracting single
text messages in between the <CODE>&lt;TOPIC&gt;</CODE>; and <CODE>&lt;/TOPIC&gt;</CODE>
tags in this file. The text
between these tags is then displayed on the screen.
<P>
If you still wish to translate this file,
what you need to do here is simply translate all the text which follows
a <CODE>&lt;TOPIC&gt;</CODE> tag. The text is displayed &quot;as is&quot;,
and no formatting is
performed; as a result, you must take care that no more than 80
characters are contained in a line.
<P>
You also should take care of the line breaks: it makes a difference
in output whether a <CODE>&lt;/TOPIC&gt;</CODE> end tag is found at the end of a line
or at the beginning of a new line, because in the latter case, the
line break is still printed to the screen.
<P>
Just one more note: Do not change the keys mentioned in this file
(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;N&quot;), even if your language
does not use &quot;Y&quot; for saying
&quot;Yes&quot;. Unfortunately, <CODE>INSTALL.CMD</CODE> relies on these keys. <CODE>:-(</CODE>


<P><LI>
<CODE>CROBJxxx.CMD</CODE> is a straightforward REXX script which creates the
default XWorkplace Configuration Folder. Even if you don't know REXX,
don't worry: you only have to change the strings on top of the file,
which contain all the language-dependent things. Be careful with the quotes.
Do not change anything else, because XWorkplace relies on it.

<P>This REXX script now gets called by WarpIN after all files have been unpacked.
Also, this gets called when the "Recreate config folder" button is pressed on the
"Objects" page in the "XWorkplace Setup" object.

<P><LI>
Similarly, <CODE>INSTLxxx.CMD</CODE> creates the default XWorkplace installation
objects (the "XWorkplace" folder plus all the new settings objects).

<P>This REXX script now gets called by WarpIN after all files have been unpacked.

<P><LI>
<CODE>SOUNDxxx.CMD</CODE> is the REXX script which creates the neccessary INI
entries for having the new XWorkplace system sounds in your &quot;Sound&quot;
object. Only change the strings at the top of the file to your language.

<P>This REXX script gets called from the "Features" page in the "XWorkplace Setup"
object when extended system sounds are enabled.

<P><LI>
<CODE>XFLDRxxx.SGS</CODE> used to be a Warp 4 SmartGuide script to display the
&quot;Welcome&quot; window after XWorkplace has been installed and the WPS has
been restarted. This is no longer distributed starting XWorkplace V0.9.7, since
SmartGuide is no longer supported with OS/2. Do not translate it.
