<!-- V1.0.6: updated the following, removed parts about old installation method -->
The <CODE>MISC</CODE> directory contains files used by XWorkplace's installation script
as well as message files and description files for WPS classes and drivers.


<UL>
<!-- V1.0.6: removed the following since the file is no longer used
             and has been removed from CVS
<LI>
<CODE>INSTxxx.MSG</CODE> (with &quot;xxx&quot; being your country code)
was used for installation messages before the WarpIN installer was used.
Even though the old <CODE>INSTALL.CMD</CODE> still works for XWorkplace,
<B>it really doesn't make much sense to translate this message file any more.</B>

<P>The file was used by <CODE>XHELP.CMD</CODE> (in the XWorkplace
package, taken from my CommandPak), which is capable of extracting single
text messages in between the <CODE>&lt;TOPIC&gt;</CODE>; and <CODE>&lt;/TOPIC&gt;</CODE>
tags in this file. The text
between these tags is then displayed on the screen.
<P>
If you still wish to translate this file,
what you need to do here is simply translate all the text which follows
a <CODE>&lt;TOPIC&gt;</CODE> tag. The text is displayed &quot;as is&quot;,
and no formatting is
performed; as a result, you must take care that no more than 80
characters are contained in a line.
<P>
You also should take care of the line breaks: it makes a difference
in output whether a <CODE>&lt;/TOPIC&gt;</CODE> end tag is found at the end of a line
or at the beginning of a new line, because in the latter case, the
line break is still printed to the screen.
<P>
Just one more note: Do not change the keys mentioned in this file
(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;N&quot;), even if your language
does not use &quot;Y&quot; for saying
&quot;Yes&quot;. Unfortunately, <CODE>INSTALL.CMD</CODE> relies on these keys. <CODE>:-(</CODE>
-->


<LI><CODE>INSTLxxx.CMD</CODE> is a straightforward REXX script which creates the
default XWorkplace installation objects (the "XWorkplace" folder plus all the new
settings objects). Even if you don't know REXX,
don't worry: you only have to change the strings on top of the file,
which contain all the language-dependent things. Be careful with the quotes.
Do not change anything else, because XWorkplace relies on it.

<P>Even though XWorkplace uses WarpIN for installation, this REXX script gets
called after the first WPS restart after installation.

<P><LI>Similarly, <CODE>CROBJxxx.CMD</CODE> creates the default XWorkplace
Configuration Folder.

<P>This REXX script gets called by <CODE>INSTLxxx.CMD</CODE>.
Also, this gets called independently when the "Recreate config folder" button
is pressed on the "Objects" page in the "XWorkplace Setup" object.

<P><LI>
<CODE>SOUNDxxx.CMD</CODE> is the REXX script which creates the neccessary INI
entries for having the new XWorkplace system sounds in your &quot;Sound&quot;
object. Only change the strings at the top of the file to your language.

<P>This REXX script gets called from the "Features" page in the "XWorkplace Setup"
object when extended system sounds are enabled.

<!-- V1.0.6: added the following item -->
<P><LI>
<CODE>XFLDRxxx.TMF</CODE> is a text message file (TMF) that contains various
XWorkplace messages. Look at each line after the
message identifier (in angle brackets) and translate only that
part. Beware of line breaks, as these messages will normally be
formatted by XWorkplace. Inserting line breaks will cause
<B>additional</B> line breaks to be displayed.

<P>Also, make sure to keep all those &quot;%1&quot;, &quot;%c&quot;, &quot;%s&quot;, etc. thingies in
place, because those placeholders will be replaced at run-time with
variable information. XWorkplace might crash if these placeholders
are not found or, even worse, if a &quot;%s&quot; key doesn't get a string but
a decimal number in sprintf.

<!-- V1.0.6: added the following item -->
<P><LI><CODE>XWPFULLxxx.TMF</CODE> and <CODE>XWPLITExxx.TMF</CODE> are text message
files (TMF) as well. These two contain messages that are different for XWorkplace
and eWorkplace. Depending on which version is to be created, the corresponding
file is concatenated with <CODE>XFDLRxxx.TMF</CODE> in the build process.

<!-- V1.0.6: added the following item -->
<P><LI><CODE>DRVRSxxx.TXT</CODE> contains all descriptions for drivers that
can be displayed on the &quot;Drivers&quot; page of the &quot;OS/2 Kernel&quot;
object. In addition, it also defines the tree structure that is used to
group the drivers and possible sources of further information. Be careful to
translate the category names and driver titles only. More information about
the syntax is included in the file itself.

<!-- V1.0.6: added the following item -->
<P><LI><CODE>XFCLSxxx.TXT</CODE> contains all WPS class descriptions that are
displayed in the upper right part of the &quot;WPS Class List&quot; object's
window. When translating the file, translate the descriptions to the right
of the class name and the digit in each line. Do not change the class names or the
digit to the right. Also, do not enter any line breaks even if that means
that a line gets very long. More information about
the syntax is included in the file itself.

<!-- V1.0.6: removed the following item since the file is no longer used and
             has been removed from CVS

<P><LI>
<CODE>XFLDRxxx.SGS</CODE> used to be a Warp 4 SmartGuide script to display the
&quot;Welcome&quot; window after XWorkplace has been installed and the WPS has
been restarted. This is no longer distributed starting XWorkplace V0.9.7, since
SmartGuide is no longer supported with OS/2. Do not translate it.
