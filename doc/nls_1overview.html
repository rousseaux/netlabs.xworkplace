<P><B>Note:</B>
If you have already started translating XWorkplace, please do read the
<CODE>changelog.txt</CODE> file. Please mind these important changes,
or the current XWorkplace version will not run with your NLS files properly.

<P><B>Legal notes.</B> XWorkplace is placed under the
GNU General Public License (GPL), including the National Language Support (NLS).
If you translate the NLS part to your language, you create
"a work based on the Program" in the GPL sense. As a result, the
GPL automatically applies to your translation too.
<P><B>This means that you have to publish your source code also.</B>

<P>Now, to move away from the Legalese, I suggest that you do
not distribute XWorkplace NLS packages yourself. Note that this is
not a legal requirement (you may do so if you ship the source code
also), but for practical reasons, mainly the following two:
<P>For one, all the NLS packages should be available from
my homepage for convience.
<P>Secondly, since
I might update XWorkplace after you have finished your work on your
NLS version, XWorkplace might have trouble cooperating with your
files. Internal IDs might change and/or new features might be
added.
So if you have finished creating your NLS package, please contact
me, and I will put in on my homepage and upload it to the usual
places where XWorkplace is normally available.
<P>This seems like the best solution
to be, because I have a list of places which carry XWorkplace, and I
can update all the NLS packages myself when anything changes with
XWorkplace. This way, my homepage will always be the place to look
for up-to-date NLS packages.
<P>
Thus, when you're done translating, please zip up the complete
directory tree again and mail the ZIP file back to me.

<P>
<B>How it works.</B>
XWorkplace NLS packages identify themselves to the XWorkplace core via
<B>country codes,</B> as described on the &quot;COUNTRY&quot; page in the
<I>OS/2 Command Reference</I> (CMDREF.INF).

<P>XWorkplace's language depends on exactly one setting in OS2.INI (application
"XWorkplace", key "LanguageCode"). If that setting is changed, XWorkplace assumes a
whole new set of language files to be present.

<P>With the XWorkplace sources, you will find everything for creating the English
NLS package, as it comes with the standard XWorkplace binary release.
The language code for English is &quot;001&quot;. Everything that is related
to English NLS is therefore in the <CODE>001\</CODE> directory tree.

<P>The <B>first step</B> you'll have to take is finding out your country
code. For example, Italian would be 039.
<P>
Unfortunately, XWorkplace's National Language Support (NLS) is spread across quite
a number of files, which have different file formats.
<P>
Basically, XWorkplace's NLS can be separated into three parts:
<OL><LI><B>Run-time NLS:</B> this is all the language-dependent
things that XWorkplace will ever display to the user, such as menus,
dialogs, messages, and notebook pages.
<P>Here we have:

<BR><UL><LI>The <B>NLS DLL</B> to be put into the XWorkplace <CODE>bin</CODE>
subdirectory.
This file contains all language-dependent Presentation Manager (PM) resources,
mostly dialogs and menus. Also, a lot of strings are stored here.
<P>The NLS DLL is called <CODE>XFLDRxxx.DLL</CODE>, with &quot;xxx&quot; being your
three-digit language code.
The files neccessary to translate this DLL are in the <CODE>001\dll</CODE>
directory. All this goes into <CODE>bin\xfldr001.dll</CODE> in the binary
release.
<P>See <A HREF="nls_4dll.html">"The main NLS DLL"</A> for details.

<P><LI>The XWorkplace <B>message file</B> introduced with V0.80 residing in the
HELP subdirectory. This file holds all kinds of messages which
are mostly displayed in XWorkplace's message boxes and are too large to be put into
the resources of the NLS DLL (because PM string resources are limited to 256
characters, unfortunately).
<P>With V0.9.0, the message file format has changed. Previously, the file was
called <CODE>XFLDRxxx.MSG</CODE>, with &quot;xxx&quot; being your
three-digit language code, and an IBM utility called <CODE>MKMSGF.EXE</CODE> was
required to compile the actual message file. Now, this file has the <CODE>.TMF</CODE>
ending and is compiled at run-time into that file's extended attributes, so there's
no additional utilities needed.
<P>This file is <CODE>001\misc\xfldr001.tmf</CODE> in the sources. This is
<CODE>help\xfldr001.tmf</CODE> in the binary release.
<P>See <A HREF="nls_4dll.html">"The main NLS DLL"</A> for details.

<P><LI>The <B>WPS class descriptions</B> which are displayed on the
&quot;WPS Classes&quot;
settings page in the &quot;Workplace Shell&quot; object. This was introduced
with XFolder 0.80 also.
<P>This file is called <CODE>XFCLSxxx.TXT</CODE>, with &quot;xxx&quot; being your
three-digit language code. It also resides in the <CODE>001\misc</CODE> directory.
<P>See <A HREF="nls_7misc.html">"Other files"</A> for details.

<P><LI>A number of REXX .CMD and text files for XWorkplace's installation.
The files to be translated are in the <CODE>001\misc</CODE> subdirectory
and go into <CODE>install\</CODE> in the binary release.
<P>See <A HREF="nls_7misc.html">"Other files"</A> for details.

</UL><BR><LI><B>Documentation:</B> the XWorkplace User Guide (INF file) and online
help (HLP file). This is not absolutely necessary and probably the larger
part of the translation work, since I have written so much text over time.

<P>Here we have:

<BR><UL><LI>The <B>XWorkplace Online Reference (INF)</B> in the XWorkplace main directory.
<P>This file is called <CODE>XFLDRxxx.INF</CODE>, with &quot;xxx&quot; being your
three-digit language code.
The HTML source files neccessary to translate this file are in the <CODE>001/inf.001</CODE>
subdirectory.
<P>See <A HREF="nls_5infhlp.html">"The INF and HLP files"</A> for details.

<P><LI>The <B>XWorkplace HLP file</B> in the HELP subdirectory. This file holds
all the help panels that are displayed when you press F1.
<P>This file is called <CODE>XFLDRxxx.HLP</CODE>, with &quot;xxx&quot; being your
three-digit language code.
The files neccessary to translate this file are in the <CODE>001/xwphelp</CODE>
subdirectory.
<P>See <A HREF="nls_5infhlp.html">"The INF and HLP files"</A> for details.

</UL><BR><LI><B>Installation:</B> a number of files which are only used while
XWorkplace is being installed. These set up XWorkplace objects and INI keys
in a certain language. Please see the README in the <CODE>MISC</CODE>
directory for details.

<P><LI>The Warp 4 SmartGuide script which was present with XFolder and XWorkplace
before V0.9.7 is gone now.

</OL>The <CODE>TOOLS</CODE> directory contains a valuable tool for converting
HTML files to the IBM (IPF) format. This will be described on a
<A HREF="nls_6html2ipf.html">separate page.</A>
This directory also contains a few other needed tools. See the
separate README in that directory.

<P>
BTW: I'm really curious how &quot;Snap to grid&quot; sounds in your language. <CODE>;-)</CODE>
