<P>
The <CODE>TOOLS</CODE> directory contains the very valuable HTML2IPF tool by
Andrew Pavel Zabolotny. This REXX script is capable of creating a single
<CODE>.IPF</CODE> file from a list of linked HTML files, which can then be passed to
IBM's <CODE>IPFC.EXE</CODE> for creating <CODE>.HLP</CODE> and <CODE>.INF</CODE> files.
<P>
I have slightly modified this tool (see notes below).
<P>
Even if you don't know what I'm talking about, in this directory, you
need to open <CODE>HTML2IPF.CMD</CODE> and change three, maybe four things:

<UL>
<LI>
In line 27, translate the <CODE>Resources on the Internet</CODE> string.

<LI>
In lines 28-31, translate the string beginning with <CODE>This chapter contains...</CODE>
translate every line, but do not mess with the <CODE>'||'0d0a'x</CODE> codes
and such.

<LI>
In lines 34/35 translate the <CODE>Click below to launch [code] with this URL:</CODE>
string, but do not change the code in the middle.

<LI>
In line 20, change the image converter; this is thoroughly explained in
the <A HREF="nls_6images.html">Images</A> section.


</UL>
<B>Additional information (not obligatory)</B>

<P>
I have included HTML2IPF.INF, which describes how the tool works. You
need not bother with this though, because everything is already set up
properly.
<P>
I have changed HTML2IPF.CMD in a few places to allow for IPF window
positioning and certain extra character formatting. These changes are
only documented here, in case you're interested -- you will NOT find
these changes in the INF file (you don't have to know this, just if
you're curious):

<UL>
<LI>
The &lt;HTML&gt; tag has new attributes: XPOS= and YPOS= work just like
IPF's &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; tags; WIDTH= and HEIGHT are the same as in IPF.

<LI>
Added the strings described above to global variables for NLS.

<LI>
The &lt;A&gt; tag accepts a new &quot;AUTO=&quot; attribute, which works just like
&quot;HREF=&quot;, but automatically opens and closes the window (this is, for
example, used on the &quot;Introduction&quot; page of the <I>XWorkplace Online Reference</I>).

<LI>
The &lt;CITE&gt; and &lt;/CITE&gt; formatting tags are now set to use a
non-proportional font, which is used extensively.

<LI>
Some formatting changes (&lt;UL&gt;, &lt;BR&gt;, &lt;B&gt; etc.).

<LI>
HTML2IPF now removes indenting spaces at the beginning of lines
because these would all appear in the INF/HLP files, while HTML
ignores them. (New with V0.81).
