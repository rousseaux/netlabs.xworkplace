Debugging WPS applications can be really tiresome, because you have to restart
the WPS for every tiny change you made to the source codes to take effect. And,
as with any PM program, you can't just <CODE>printf()</CODE> stuff to the screen.
Even worse, it's hard to use the PM debugger, because you have to start the whole
WPS (<CODE>PMSHELL.EXE</CODE>) with it, since <CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE> is no standalone
application.

<P>So I had to look for something else.

<P>Those <CODE>_Pmpf((&quot;xxx&quot;))</CODE> thingies are for the
magnificent PMPRINTF package by Dennis Bareis.
These only display anything if the proper <CODE>DEBUG_xxx</CODE> #define's are set in
<CODE>include\setup.h</CODE> (changed with V0.9.0).
For the release version of XWorkplace, all these flags
have been disabled, so no additional code is produced at all. You
thus don't have to remove the commands to speed up XWorkplace, because this
wouldn't make any difference.

<P>Some files from the PMPRINTF package are included so that you can
compile. The PM interface which actually displays the messages is not
however. This has been written by Dennis Bareis. Last time I checked
(March 13, 2001), this package was available at
<A HREF="http://www.labyrinth.net.au/~dbareis/zips_fw/pmf96179.zip">http://www.labyrinth.net.au/~dbareis/zips_fw/pmf96179.zip</A>.

<P>However, to really use PMPRINTF, you'll have to put some DLLs
on your LIBPATH. See the PMPRINTF docs for details. I strongly
recommend using this utility.

<P><CODE>_Pmpf((&quot;xxx&quot;))</CODE> uses regular printf syntax, except for those
strange double brackets, which are needed because macros don't accept
variable parameter lists otherwise.
