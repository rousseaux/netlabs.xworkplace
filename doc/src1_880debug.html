Debugging WPS applications can be really tiresome, because you have to restart
the WPS for every tiny change you made to the source codes to take effect. And,
as with any PM program, you can't just <CODE>printf()</CODE> stuff to the screen.
Even worse, it's hard to use the PM debugger, because you have to start the whole
WPS (<CODE>PMSHELL.EXE</CODE>) with it, since <CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE> is no standalone
application.

<P>So I had to look for something else.

<P>Those <CODE>_Pmpf((&quot;xxx&quot;))</CODE> thingies are for the
magnificent PMPRINTF package by Dennis Bareis.
These only display anything if the proper <CODE>DEBUG_xxx</CODE> #define's are set in
<CODE>include\setup.h</CODE> (changed with V0.9.0).
For the release version of XWorkplace, all these flags
have been disabled, so no additional code is produced at all. You
thus don't have to remove the commands to speed up XWorkplace, because this
wouldn't make any difference.

<P>Some files from the PMPRINTF package are included so that you can
compile. The PM interface which actually displays the messages is not
however. Check Dennis Bareis' homepage at
<A HREF="http://www.ozemail.com.au/~dbareis/">http://www.ozemail.com.au/~dbareis/</A> where you'll find tons of other
useful utilities too.

<P>However, to really use PMPRINTF, you'll have to put some DLLs
on your LIBPATH. See the PMPRINTF docs for details. I strongly
recommend using this utility.

<P><CODE>_Pmpf((&quot;xxx&quot;))</CODE> uses regular printf syntax, except for those
strange double brackets, which are needed because macros don't accept
variable parameter lists otherwise.

<P><B>IMPORTANT NOTE:</B> If you #define any of the flags at the top of
<CODE>include\setup.h</CODE>, <B>you must have the PMPRINTF DLLs somewhere on your
LIBPATH,</B> or otherwise you'll spend days figuring out why XWorkplace is
simply not working any more. (I had this recently after a reinstall
of OS/2, after which the DLLs where gone.) That is, XWorkplace classes
will not load at WPS startup, because the PMPRINTF imports cannot be
resolved. Neither will registering XWorkplace classes succeed. And don't
expect to get an error message other than FALSE. <CODE>:-(</CODE>
