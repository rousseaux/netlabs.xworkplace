Debugging WPS applications can be really tiresome, because you have to restart
the WPS for every tiny change you made to the source codes to take effect. And,
as with any PM program, you can't just <CODE>printf()</CODE> stuff to the screen.
Even worse, it's hard to use the PM debugger, because you have to start the whole
WPS (<CODE>PMSHELL.EXE</CODE>) with it, since <CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE> is no standalone
application.

<P>So I had to look for something else.

<P>To enable the debug build, set <CODE>XWP_DEBUG</CODE> in
<A HREF="src1_32env.html">config.in</A>. <B>Again, mind the warnings given
there.</B> Of course, you will then have to cause a complete rebuild by
deleting the <CODE>bin\</CODE> directory.

<P>Enabling the debug code has a large number of consequences:

<OL><LI>Since in debug mode, the <CODE>__DEBUG__</CODE> define is passed on the compiler
command line, many other parts of the code can react to that. For example, you will
find a few interesting new items in the Desktop's context menu, such as "Crash WPS"
to test the exception handlers.

<P><LI>Depending on whether <CODE>__XWPMEMDEBUG__</CODE> is uncommented at the bottom
of <CODE>include\setup.h</CODE>, all memory management functions will be replaced
by debug versions which give you very detailed logs of all memory that was ever
allocated. See <CODE>memdebug.c</CODE> in the helpers for details. This will also
produce an additional Desktop context menu item which will open a PM window with
lots of information.

<P><LI>There are a large number of <CODE>_Pmpf((&quot;xxx&quot;))</CODE> calls
in the code. These are for the magnificent PMPRINTF package by Dennis Bareis.

<P>Some files from the PMPRINTF package are included so that you can
compile. The PM interface which actually displays the messages <B>plus the required DLLs</B>
which must be on the LIBPATH are not however. Last time I checked (March 13, 2001),
this package was available at
<A HREF="http://www.labyrinth.net.au/~dbareis/zips_fw/pmf96179.zip">http://www.labyrinth.net.au/~dbareis/zips_fw/pmf96179.zip</A>.

<P>These calls only display anything if the proper <CODE>DEBUG_xxx</CODE> #define's
are set in <CODE>include\setup.h</CODE> (changed with V0.9.0). You can conditionally
enable groups of debugging flags in there, but some of them haven't been tested in
a long while and might cause compilation errors.

<P>For the release version of XWorkplace, all these flags
have been disabled, so no additional code is produced at all. You
thus don't have to remove the commands to speed up XWorkplace, because this
wouldn't make any difference.

<P><CODE>_Pmpf((&quot;xxx&quot;))</CODE> uses regular printf syntax, except for those
strange double brackets, which are needed because macros don't accept
variable parameter lists otherwise.
