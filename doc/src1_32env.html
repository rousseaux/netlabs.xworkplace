Makefile Environment Variables

<BODY TEXT="#000000" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" LINK="#0000AA" VLINK="#777777">
This section describes the environment variables which should be set
externally before executing the makefiles.

<P>You can modify <CODE>MAKE.CMD</CODE> to set up these things, because
<CODE>MAKE.CMD</CODE> calls the main <CODE>makefile</CODE>.

<P>Alternatively, create your own "XWorkplace make" command file, which
sets up these variables, or define these variables in CONFIG.SYS.

<P>If these are not set, you'll either get errors from the makefiles
(certain checks are built into those), or <CODE>setup.in</CODE> will
use some dumb default, which is most probably not matching your system.

<OL><LI><CODE>PROJECT_BASE_DIR</CODE> points to the base directory of
the XWorkplace source tree. This must be the parent directory of <CODE>src\</CODE>,
<CODE>include\,</CODE> etc. This is required for the makefiles to work, because
otherwise they'll never know where to recurse to.

<P><LI>If <CODE>XWPDEBUG</CODE> is defined (to anything), XWorkplace will
be compiled and linked with debug code enabled. Also, this will pass the
<CODE>__XWPDEBUG__</CODE> define to the compiler, to which some code parts
react. For example, only if that flag is defined, PmPrintf calls will be
compiled. See <A HREF="src1_880debug.html">"Debugging XWorkplace"</A> for details.

<P><LI><CODE>XWPRUNNING</CODE> must point to an exiting XFolder/XWorkplace
installation. Since the makefiles first create all the files in <CODE>bin\</CODE>,
this is not suitable for testing your code, because XWorkplace expects a lot
of files at fixed locations relative to the directory where <CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE>
resides. Most makefiles will copy the target files to the directory pointed to
by this environment variable (after unlocking executables), so after rebuilding,
you can simply restart the WPS, and your new code will be running in the WPS.

<P>This must point to the parent directory of <CODE>bin\</CODE>, <CODE>help\</CODE> etc.
in the XFolder/XWorkplace installation tree.

<P><LI><CODE>XWPRELEASE</CODE> is only used with <CODE>nmake release</CODE>.
This specifies the base directory where to build a complete XWorkplace release. If
this directory does not exist, it is created.

<P><LI><CODE>HELPERS_BASE</CODE> is required. This must point to the WarpIN CVS source
tree, from which XWorkplace steals the <A HREF="src1_5helpers.html">helpers code</A>.
This must point to the parent directory of <CODE>src\</CODE> in the WarpIN tree.
