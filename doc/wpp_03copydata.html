Trace session: Drag-Copying Data Files

The worst thing about the WPS is that its most central operations are
largely undocumented. It is nearly impossible to find any documentation
about what the actual file operations methods (<CODE>wpCopyObject</CODE>
and such) actually do, who calls them, and what all these WPS threads
are doing.

<P>To find out more, I have done an extensive debugging session tracing the
method calls during a copy operation.
You can find the whole log in the <CODE>logs\copydrag.log</CODE> file.
The operation which was logged was a Ctrl-Drag (copy) of the "check.c"
file within the same folder so that the "File clash" dialog (actually,
my replacement) comes up, the target object is renamed, and then copying
actually starts.

<P>During this operation, I roughly got the following:

<UL><LI>On the folder thread (usually TID 1), after the object
     has been dropped (start copying),
     the WPS calls <CODE>wpSetTaskRec</CODE> on the source object to
     prepare the <CODE>wpCopyObject</CODE> call, which will later run
     on the Tasker thread (TID 12 during my debugging).
     This increases the task rec's usage count to 1.

<P><LI>Apparently, the WPS then throws some notification to
     the Tasker thread (TID 12) to start copying. Anyways,
     we get a <CODE>wpMenuItemSelected</CODE> (during drag'n'drop!!)
     on the source object being copied on TID 12. The Tasker
     thread then calls <CODE>wpFindTaskRec</CODE> to find out what to do.

<P><LI>The Tasker thread then calls <CODE>wpConfirmObjectTitle</CODE> to
     have the object renamed, if a name clash occurs.

<P><LI>Immediately afterwards, the Tasker thread calls <CODE>wpCopyObject</CODE>.
     So <CODE>wpCopyObject</CODE> here ran on task 12!
     <CODE>wpCopyObject</CODE> calls <CODE>wpFindTaskRec</CODE>
     again (even twice...).

     <P><CODE>wpCopyObject</CODE> creates a new SOM instance of the same class
     as the source object. However, <CODE>wpclsNew</CODE> does NOT get called.
     I have yet to find out how this is done. On the new object,
     the following method calls were traced (maybe the caller is
     still <CODE>wpCopyObject</CODE> or some other in-between-code):

<PRE>
     --  wpInitData calls
         --  wpSetDefaultView
         --  wpSetDefaultIconPos -- is this copied from the task rec?
     --  wpSetAttr
     --  wpSetRealName calls
         -- wpCnrRefreshDetails
     --  wpSetType
     --  wpSetFolder
     --  wpModifyStyle
     --  wpLockObject
     --  wpSetTitle calls
         --  wpQueryConfirmations
         --  wpSetTitleAndRenameFile calls
             --  wpQueryFilename
             --  wpSetRealName (again!!) calls
                 -- wpCnrRefreshDetails
     --  wpSetupOnce calls
         --  wpSetup calls
             --  wpSetTaskRec(pNew, NULL); pNew is the same TASKREC
                             which was set for the source object
                             -- but how does wpSetup know about the source object?
                             Anyways, we now have a usage of 2;
     --  wpQueryContainerFlagPtr
     --  wpLockObject (again!!)
     --  wpQueryDefaultIconPos, preparing
     --  wpCnrInsertObject, calling LOTS of methods for inserting the object
     --  wpUnlockObject (undoes the second call);
</PRE>
<P>Then we get a number of save/restore method calls (still in <CODE>wpCopyObject</CODE>):

<PRE>
     --  wpSaveState(pSource);
     --  wpRestoreState(pNew);   aha!! (lots of method calls)
     --  wpModifyStyle(pNew), which calls wpQueryAttr on pSource (how does it know?)
     --  wpSetIcon(pNew);
     --  wpSaveDeferred(pNew).
</PRE>

<P>THEN we finally get the <CODE>wpObjectReady(pNew)</CODE> before
    <CODE>wpCopyObject(pSource)</CODE>
     returns.

     In short, the initialization methods are as follows:
<PRE>
     --  wpCopyObject(pSource) calls
         --  wpInitData(pNew);
         --  lots of wpSet*(pNew) calls;
         --  wpSetupOnce(pNew);
         --  wpCnrInsertObject(pNew);
         --  wpRestoreState(pNew));
         --  wpSetIcon(pNew);
         --  wpObjectReady(pNew).
</PRE>

<P><LI>After <CODE>wpCopyObject</CODE> returns, <CODE>wpQueryError</CODE> is checked and
     <CODE>wpSetTaskRec(NULL, pOld)</CODE> is invoked on the source object
     and then the newly instantiated object, both times with
     <CODE>pOld</CODE> being the same task rec as above.

     <P>A few seconds later, <CODE>wpSaveImmediate</CODE> is running on TID 10,
     which apparently is the lazy writer thread which has been
     informed by the <CODE>wpSaveDeferred</CODE> call above.
