<P>
The images in both the INF and HELP directory are always available
in both GIF and uncompressed OS/2 1.3 BMP format. The reason for
this is that HTML does not support BMP, and IPF does not support
GIF. <CODE>:-(</CODE>
<P>HTML2IPF is very comfortable in this respect: it will
automatically convert all GIF images to BMP format every time it
finds an &lt;IMG&gt; tag, but only if no BMP file of the same filestem
was found (see <CODE>HTML2IPF.INF</CODE> for details).
<P>
The image conversion program which HTML2IPF requires is specified
in line 20 of <CODE>HTML2IPF.CMD</CODE>. The original had Image Alchemy in here,
I have changed it to &quot;GBMSIZE&quot;, which is part of the freeware
&quot;Generalized Bitmap Module&quot; (GBM) package available at Hobbes.

<UL><LI>
If you don't have GBMSIZE on your PATH, you can add the path to
this line.

<P><LI>If you wish to use a different converter, specify it here. Be
careful though: <B>IPFC only supports uncompressed OS/2 1.3 bitmaps</B>
(see <CODE>HTML2IPF.INF</CODE>). That is, neither compressed bitmaps nor
Windows or OS/2 2.0 bitmaps work. This is annoying, because
IPFC's own image compression is totally outdated, but there's nothing we
can do about this.

</UL>
I'd be very grateful if you could create your own screenshots
for the online documentation, because I own German versions of OS/2
and for your NLS package, screenshots of your language are
preferrable, at least for those pictures which have language-dependent
stuff in them.
<P>

I have used the following settings for the screenshots (just for your
information, you don't have to use these):

<PRE>

Fonts used:
Titlebars: Humanist 521, 13 points (available on the
           CorelDraw 4 CD in Type 1 format)
All the other fonts are set to 9.WarpSans.

CandyBarZ installed, colors:
Active:     top 191/0/0, bottom 52/0/0
Inactive:   top 160/160/130, bottom 40/40/40

Oh yes, XWorkplace installed. ;-)
</PRE>

Now, if you create your own screenshots, save them as GIFs with the
exact filenames of the originals (e.g. <CODE>trunc.gif</CODE>); you must then
DELETE the respective BMP file, because HTML2IPF will only call the
image converter for BMP if no BMP file of the same name exists.
<P>
<B>Tricks to reduce file sizes:</B>
<P>
Keep in mind that HLP/INF files have their own compression scheme which
works best when much redundant data is in the bitmap files. That is,
large areas of a plain color can be compressed best.
<P>So taking screenshots of folders with background bitmaps is a no-no, because
this will really blow up the files.
<P>And use as few colors as possible. You can use PMView to reduce the number
of colors to, say, 12 colors, which usually still looks alright. Make
sure you don't have &quot;dithering&quot; or &quot;error diffusion&quot; enabled, because
this will add lots of extra pixels which will make compression less
efficient.
<P>Also, if you need to scale images to a smaller size, make sure not to
enable any "interpolation", i.e. introducing extra pixels to make colors smoother.
This adds lots more colors to the file, which cannot be compressed well.
