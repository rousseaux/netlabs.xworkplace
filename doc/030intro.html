Welcome to the XWorkplace source code!

<P>This book has been written by
XFolder's and XWorkplace's original author, Ulrich M”ller, to introduce
you to the world of XWorkplace programming.

<P><B>Note:</B> You must unzip this package on a HPFS drive
because many files in this package contain long file names.

<P>This book covers two different things:

<OL><LI>Information about <B>XWorkplace National Language Support (NLS).</B> This is of
interest for people who would like to translate XWorkplace to a new language. No
knowledge of C programming is required for translations, but knowing HTML helps.

<P>See <A HREF="040nls.html">"National Language Support"</A> for more information.

<P><LI>Information about the <B>XWorkplace C source code.</B>
This is mainly of interest
for programmers who would like to contribute to XWorkplace, find bugs, or who are just
interested in learning how the thing is functioning.
<P>See <A HREF="050source1.html">"The XWorkplace Source Code"</A> for a general
introduction and how to compile.
<P>See <A HREF="051source2.html">"Source Code Details"</A> for information about
specific XWorkplace features and their implementation. This is useful for contributors.
<P>See <A HREF="055extend.html">"Adding Features to XWorkplace"</A> for information about
how to hook your own code into XWorkplace.

</OL>If you have questions, please post a message to
<CODE>xworkplace-dev@yahoogroups.com</CODE>, which is the mailing list for XWorkplace
developers.

<P>But if you want to start writing WPS classes,
please don't start asking things like &quot;What is an IDL file?&quot;. If
you have never created a WPS class, please read the excellent courses at
EDM/2 (<A HREF="http://www.edm2.com">www.edm2.com</A>) first,
which explain a lot of things to get you
started. As far as I know, XWorkplace is the most complex WPS source code
available, and it probably does not serve very well as a WPS beginner's
tutorial.

<P>Thanks!
<BR>
