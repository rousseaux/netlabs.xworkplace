This section describes what to do if you want to write some all new SOM WPS class,
which should be integrated into the main XWorkplace DLL, and describe which files
need to be changed to have your stuff compiled into the whole thing.

<OL><LI>Most importantly, I suggest that you put all your code into a
<B>separate source directory</B>
in the XWorkplace <CODE>SRC\</CODE> and <CODE>INCLUDE\</CODE> directory trees.
Please do not put your stuff into <CODE>SRC\FILESYS</CODE>,
because this will make it pretty difficult to maintain order.
For the purpose of explanations here, I will assume that your directory is
called <CODE>SRC\YOURDIR\</CODE> and your class is called <CODE>XWPYourClass</CODE>.

<P>So first of all, create your two subdirectories (<CODE>YOURDIR</CODE>) in
<CODE>INCLUDE</CODE> and <CODE>SRC</CODE>.

<P><LI>Put your new IDL file into the <CODE>IDL\</CODE> directory and modify the
makefile in there to recognize your IDL file. That is, add your header file to
the <CODE>all:</CODE> statement and add a line to the bottom. And please, add a
comment that you did so.
<P>For the purpose of clarity, I suggest that with your IDL file, you take one
of the existing IDL files as a template. My IDL coding style has evolved during
the last two years, and I now consider the comments etc. in there pretty lucid
in order not to forget anything. Of course, if you have something better, go ahead.

<P><LI>In <CODE>SRC\YOURDIR\</CODE>, write your own makefile which compiles your
sources. You can take the makefile in <CODE>SRC\FILESYS\</CODE> as a template. This
makefile is pretty smart because it automatically recognizes whether it is called
from the main makefile, and if not, it invokes the main makefile, which in turn
will call the sub-makefiles later. Also, that makefile uses the general makefile
include <CODE>setup.in</CODE> in the main directory for compiler setup etc.

<P>Make sure that your makefile writes all <CODE>.OBJ</CODE> files into the
<CODE>BIN</CODE> directory, which your makefile must create if it doesn't exist yet.
Again, see how the makefile in <CODE>SRC\FILESYS</CODE> does this.

<P>Other than that, in <CODE>SRC\YOURDIR</CODE>, do whatever you want.

<P><LI><B>Coding.</B> For your C code, make sure that you get the <CODE>#include</CODE>'s
right.
Take a look at any C file in <CODE>SRC\FILESYS</CODE> for examples (<CODE>folder.c</CODE>
is a good candidate, because it's fairly complex). If you use any headers from
<CODE>include\shared\</CODE>, there are certain rules that you must follow, because
these headers require other headers to be included already.
<P>Also, I strongly recommend to <I>always</I> include <CODE>include\setup.h</CODE>,
because this will automatically make your code PMPRINTF-enabled.
<P>I don't care about your <B>coding style,</B> but if you want your code to be
documented automatically, you should follow mine, because otherwise
<CODE>xdoc.exe</CODE> won't work.
See <A HREF="src1_4docs.html">Code documentation</A> for details.

<P><LI>Note that the SOM compiler is unable to recognize that several
classes should be put into the same DLL and create a common .DEF file for this
purpose, so you have to do this manually.
<P>So have the SOM compiler create a .DEF file for your class from your .IDL
source file. (The makefile in <CODE>IDL\</CODE> will do this automatically if you
have added your header to the <CODE>all:</CODE> target.)
<P>Then take the block below the <CODE>EXPORTS</CODE> line from the .DEF file
and add it to the bottom of <CODE>src\shared\xwp.def</CODE> (which is the module
definition file used for linking the whole XWorkplace DLL). These structures make
the SOM kernel see your class in the DLL. If you don't do this, your class
cannot be registered.

<P><LI>Finally, take a look at <CODE>\makefile</CODE>. This is the "master makefile"
which links all .OBJ modules into the main XWorkplace DLL (<CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE>).
In that makefile, there is an <CODE>OBJS</CODE> macro which lists all the .OBJ files
which are to be linked together.
<P>Add your .OBJ file(s) to the end of that variable (and please, add a comment that
you did so).

</OL>This should work. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.
