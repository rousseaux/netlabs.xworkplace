XWorkplace strictly separates language-dependent resources from the
rest of the program. To make things easier, all language-dependent
resources are in the "001" subtree of the main XWorkplace directory,
which holds all English NLS files.

Here's a list of things you need to do before you can begin translations.

<OL><LI>The first thing you need to do is find out your
<B>three-digit language code.</B> Open the OS/2 Command Reference, "Country"
page, and find the code for your country.

<P><LI>Make a copy of the entire <CODE>001</CODE> directory tree within
the XWorkplace source tree, renaming it to your country code. For example,
if your language is Italian, you should have a <CODE>039</CODE> tree next
to the <CODE>001</CODE> tree.

<P><LI>Some files in the <CODE>001</CODE> directory carry a three-digit language code in
their respective names. For your language, you need to change all the filenames
with &quot;001&quot; in their names to your country code (e.g. 039 for Italian).
For example, rename <CODE>dll\xfldr001.dlg</CODE> to <CODE>dll\xfldr039.dlg</CODE>.

<P><LI>You will also have to change the <CODE>dll\*.def</CODE> file and
<CODE>dll\makefile</CODE>,
which assume a country code of 001 at this point. Required changes are noted in
the files themselves.

<P><LI>Open <CODE>dll\xfldrXXX.rc</CODE> (with "xxx" being your country code) and
find the strings "ID_XSSI_DLLLANGUAGE" and "ID_XSSI_NLS_AUTHOR". Change those
two to match your language and name; this is the information that is displayed
to the user in the "Language" drop-down box in the "XWorkplace Setup" settings
object.

</OL>
You should now be ready to <B>recompile the NLS DLL</B> for the first time.
<P>
If you have IBM VAC++, you can simply use <CODE>nmake.exe</CODE> to have the DLL
recreated. Before doing so, you have to set up the build environment.
Open the file <CODE>CONFIG.IN</CODE> and adjust it according to
your system. Change <CODE>XWP_LANG_CODE</CODE> to your country code.
Now everything should work fine since all the necessary files are included. Execute
the following command: <CODE>nmake nls</CODE>

<P>
Otherwise, things get a bit more complicated. Since the
resource compiler (<CODE>RC.EXE</CODE>) is already included
with every OS/2 installation, you can try the following:
<OL><LI>Copy an existing XWorkplace resource DLL (e.g., <CODE>xfldr001.dll</CODE>)
into your new NLS directory;
rename it so that it contains your language code (e.g., <CODE>xfldr039.dll</CODE>).
<P><LI>Open a command line in that directory.
<P><LI>Type <CODE>rc xfldr039.rc xfldr039.dll</CODE> (replace "039" with your language code),
which should create a new <CODE>.RES</CODE> file and link it against the existing DLL.
</OL>

After recompiling, you can test the DLL as described in
<A HREF="nls_8testing.html">"Testing the DLL"</A>.
