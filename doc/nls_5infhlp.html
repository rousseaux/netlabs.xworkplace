The sources for the INF and HLP files are written using a slightly extended
HTML syntax. Creating INF and HLP files is therefore a two-step process:
<OL><LI>The HTML sources are translated into an .IPF source file, using
the <A HREF="nls_6html2ipf.html">HTML2IPF</A> utility.
<P><LI>Next, the .IPF source is fed into IBM's <CODE>IPFC.EXE</CODE> from the Developer's
Toolkit. See <A HREF="nls_3prep.html">"Preparations"</A> for where to get this utility.
</OL>
Please use the <CODE>MAKE.CMD</CODE> file on the top level of the XWorkplace source
files to have the doc files created. This might take a while. You will
first need to set a few environment variables on top of <CODE>MAKE.CMD</CODE>, which
is documented in that file itself.
<P>
You then have two alternatives for the translations:

<UL><LI>I recommend translating all the <CODE>.HTML</CODE> files and
keep using <CODE>MAKE.CMD</CODE>
to have the HTML files converted into a single .IPF file
(using the HTML2IPF utility), which can then be fed into <CODE>IPFC.EXE</CODE>.
<P>This has the advantage that you'll only have to change some panels
in future versions, of which I will keep track. Also, I always note changes
to the INF and HLP files in the HTML source files in HTML comments tags, so
you can easily search for what's changed.
<P>The disadvantage is that, being a REXX program, HTML2IPF is slow.

<P><LI>You can also translate the <I>one</I> <CODE>.IPF</CODE>
file in each of the INF and
HELP directories directly, if you're familiar with the IPF source
language, which is a proprietary IBM format (and which I don't like
at all).
<P>To do this, you'll have to create the two IPF source files first, using
<CODE>MAKE.CMD</CODE>. You can then translate this file and
feed it into the <CODE>IPFC.EXE</CODE> compiler
to have the .INF and .HLP files created.
<P>This has the disadvantage that if certain panels change in future
versions, you'll have no clue what parts changed in this single IPF
file, because the comments about changes are only visible in the HTML sources.
<P>If you still want to use this method, please change the text only.
Do not change any resources, IPF tags,
and especially not the resource ID's, or XWorkplace will not find its
help panels any more.
</UL>

The &quot;root&quot; file in each of the two source directories
is called <CODE>XFLDRxxx.HTML</CODE>, respectively, with &quot;xxx&quot; being your
country code (which you should change in this one filename because HTML2IPF will use this
name for the target IPF file also).

<P>To <B>use HTML2IPF manually</B> (instead of through <CODE>MAKE.CMD</CODE>),
open a command line in the INF or HLP
directory (with XWorkplace <CODE>;-)</CODE> ), and type:

<P><CODE>&lt;path&gt;\html2ipf xfldr001.html</CODE>

<P>This will create a <CODE>XFLDRxxx.IPF</CODE> file (in the above example,
XFLDR001.IPF). You can then run <CODE>ipfc XFLDRxxx.IPF</CODE> to compile
a HLP file; add an <CODE>/INF</CODE> switch to produce an &quot;INF&quot; file.
You must have the INF or HLP directory as your current directory,
or HTML2IPF will tumble.

<P>
In any case, mind these important notes:

<UL><LI>The (slightly awkward, I admit) structure of the files is the
following, in both directories:

<P><LI><CODE>XFLDRxxx.HTML</CODE> is the &quot;root&quot; file.
Files beginning with &quot;0&quot; appear in the contents tree of the
produced INF and HLP files.
All other files are somwhere below in the INF/HLP table-of-contents
hierarchy, depending on the <CODE>SUBLINKS</CODE> tags in the HTML source files.

<P><LI>Do not change filenames! HTML2IPF sorts the IPF pages internally
alphabetically according to the filenames, that's why I've
implemented these strange naming conventions. I admit that since
the structure has developed over time, it may not seem very
logical to you, but it works. Changing things here will result
in a lot of work, since all the links in the HTML files will
have to be renamed also.
<P>Also, if you change the linkage of the HTML files, the resource
IDs of the help panels will be altered, and XWorkplace will then
get confused displaying the proper help panels.


<P><LI>Within the HTML files, do not change <I>anything</I> within angle
brackets (&quot;&lt;xxx&gt;&quot;). Translate <I>only</I> the text outside of these.
Even though some tags might not be good HTML style and the
HTML files might not look pretty when viewed with Netscape,
certain tag combinations (especially the &lt;BR&gt;&lt;LI&gt; combinations)
are neccessary to make the pages look good for IPF.


<P><LI>Don't forget to translate the page titles (in between the
&lt;TITLE&gt; tags). This is what appears in the title of a panel window
and in the "Table of contents" tree. I've forgotten this many times...


<P><LI>There are a number of files in the HLP directory which seem
pretty useless. These are neccessary however in order to
guarantee a certain sequence of the help panels in the
resulting HLP file, on which XWorkplace relies for calling
a certain help panel. I don't quite understand myself anymore
how this order works, but it does, so I don't care. <CODE>;-)</CODE>


<P><LI>I do not recommend translating <I>everything</I> for the INF book.
I have done the German translation myself,
and I think that the &quot;Revision history&quot; section makes no
sense translating, because it is frequently updated and
NLS versions didn't exist for the older versions anyway.
Also, the &quot;XWorkplace Internals&quot; pages apply to programmers,
which need to know English anyway, because otherwise they
won't find their way through the required Toolkit docs
either. So I think you can save yourself some work there.
