The sources for the INF and HLP files are written using a slightly extended
HTML syntax. Creating INF and HLP files is therefore a two-step process:

<OL><LI>The HTML sources are translated into an .IPF source file, using my
the <A HREF="nls_6html2ipf.html">h2i</A> utility. I am no longer using
<CODE>html2ipf.cmd</CODE> because it's so damn slow and doesn't support
string replacements.

<P><LI>Next, the .IPF source is fed into IBM's <CODE>ipfc</CODE> from the Developer's
Toolkit. See <A HREF="nls_2requires.html">"Requirements"</A> for where to get this utility.

</OL>
Please use the <CODE>make.cmd</CODE> file on the top level of the XWorkplace source
files to have the doc files created.

<P>I recommend translating all the <CODE>.HTML</CODE> files and
keep using <CODE>make.cmd</CODE>
to have the HTML files converted into a single .IPF file
(using my <CODE>h2i</CODE> utility), which can then be fed into <CODE>ipfc</CODE>.
This has the advantage that you'll only have to change some panels
in future versions, of which I will keep track. Also, I always note changes
to the INF and HLP files in the HTML source files in HTML comments tags, so
you can easily search for what's changed.

<P>The &quot;root&quot; file in each of the two source directories
is called <CODE>xfldrXXX.html</CODE>, respectively, with &quot;xxx&quot; being your
country code (which you should change in this one filename because
<CODE>h2i</CODE> will use this name for the target IPF file also).

<P>In any case, mind these important notes:

<UL><LI>The (slightly awkward, I admit) structure of the files is the
following, in both directories:

<P><CODE>xfldrXXX.html</CODE> is the &quot;root&quot; file.
All other files are somwhere below in the INF/HLP table-of-contents
hierarchy, depending on the <CODE>SUBLINKS</CODE> tags in the HTML source files.

<P><LI>Do not change filenames! <CODE>h2i</CODE> sorts the IPF pages internally
alphabetically according to the filenames, that's why I've
implemented these strange naming conventions. I admit that since
the structure has developed over time, it may not seem very
logical to you, but it works. Changing things here will result
in a lot of work, since all the links in the HTML files would
have to be adjusted also.

<P><LI>Within the HTML files, do not change <I>anything</I> within angle
brackets (&quot;&lt;xxx&gt;&quot;). Translate <I>only</I> the text outside of these.
Even though some tags might not be good HTML style and the
HTML files might not look pretty when viewed with Netscape,
certain tag combinations (especially the &lt;BR&gt;&lt;LI&gt; combinations)
are neccessary to make the pages look good for IPF.

<P><LI>Don't forget to translate the page titles (in between the
&lt;TITLE&gt; tags). This is what appears in the title of a panel window
and in the "Table of contents" tree. I've forgotten this many times...

<P><LI>I do not recommend translating <I>everything</I> for the INF book.
For the old XFolder, I did the German translation myself,
and I think that the &quot;Revision history&quot; section makes no
sense translating, because it is frequently updated and
NLS versions didn't exist for the older versions anyway.
Also, the &quot;XWorkplace Internals&quot; pages apply to programmers,
which need to know English anyway, because otherwise they
won't find their way through the required Toolkit docs
either. So I think you can save yourself some work there.
