XWorkplace Code You Might Find Useful

This section should help you identify XWorkplace code sections which might
also be useful to you.

<OL><LI>This applies mostly to the code in the <CODE>HELPERS</CODE> directory.
All of that code is not dependent on XWorkplace and could be used in any
program. There are lots of Control Program, Presentation Manager and GPI
helper functions which might solve problems that you are having.
<P>To use the helper funcs, simply add <CODE>#include "helpers\xxx.h"</CODE>
at the top of your code. See the top of the respective header for additional
<CODE>#include</CODE>'s which are required by the helper.

<P><LI>There are some functions in <CODE>src\shared\common.c</CODE> which might be
useful to you, most notably to query some XWorkplace settings and NLS stuff.
<CODE>cmnQuerySetting</CODE> will return a global setting,
for example, or <CODE>cmnMessageBox</CODE> will display one of the pretty
XWorkplace message boxes.

<P><LI>To find out how to create a <CODE>WPAbstract</CODE> class from scratch,
including a completely new view defined by your class (like the "Class list view"),
you can take a look at <CODE>xclslist.idl</CODE> and <CODE>xclslist.c</CODE>,
which do exactly this. See the comments in that file for instructions.

<P><LI>To create a new settings object (which is not derived from WPSystem), take
a look at <CODE>XWPSetup</CODE>, a direct subclass of <CODE>WPAbstract</CODE>,
which is implemented this way.

<P><LI>For easier maintenance of notebook dialog procs, I have created
<CODE>src\shared\notebook.c</CODE>,
which does just this using callbacks, so you don't have to rewrite the same
stupid window procedures for each notebook page. This is used throughout XWorkplace's
source code whenever settings pages are inserted, and has proven to be extremely
useful.

<P><LI>Finally, <CODE>src\shared\kernel.c</CODE> contains code which you can
extend for certain tricky situations. For one, you can extend
<CODE>krnInitializeXWorkplace</CODE> to have code executed upon Desktop startup;
secondly, you can add messages to <CODE>krn_fnwpThread1Object</CODE> if you
need code to absolutely always execute on thread 1 of PMSHELL.EXE, which cannot
be guaranteed with open views of any kind (especially folder views).
