<P><B>Files that need to be changed:</B>

<UL><LI><CODE>xfldr001.def:</CODE> The module definition file.
Required changes are noted in the file itself.

<P><LI><CODE>makefile:</CODE> Makefile for IBM NMAKE.
Required changes are noted in the file itself.

<P><LI><CODE>xfldr001.rc, xfldr001.dlg:</CODE>
These are the main resource files which need <I>lots</I> of
changes.
<P>I've documented everything you need to change
in the <CODE>.RC</CODE> file.
<P>The <CODE>.DLG</CODE> file is included when the RC files is recompiled. It
contains all the XWorkplace dialogs (i.e. notebook pages and other dialog windows).
Sorry, there are no comments in there because I'm using <CODE>DLGEDIT.EXE</CODE>
to create the dialogs, which rewrites the DLG file at every change, so all comments
in there get lost.
</UL>

<B>Using a dialog editor.</B>
You can use <CODE>DLGEDIT.EXE</CODE>, the IBM dialog editor from the Developer's Toolkit,
to change the dialogs. (This will not affect the <CODE>.RC</CODE> file.) For this,
you will need to create the <CODE>.RES</CODE> file first. This is done by
<CODE>MAKE.CMD</CODE>; alternatively, you can start <CODE>RC.EXE</CODE> with the "-r" option,
which creates a <CODE>.RES</CODE> instead of linking the resources to an
executable.

<P>If you then open the <CODE>.RES</CODE> file with the dialog editor, you can
choose <CODE>src/main/dlgids.h</CODE> as an include file so that all the numerical ID's
have a more meaningful name.
<P>
When you then save the file, the <CODE>.RES</CODE> and <CODE>.DLG</CODE> files will be
recreated by DLGEDIT.
The <CODE>.RC</CODE> file remains untouched though.
<P>
The dialog editor has a helpful &quot;Translate mode&quot; in its &quot;Options&quot; menu
which disables a lot of menu items so you don't accidentally change dlg ID's
or other important stuff.
<P>
I don't know if you can use the URE editor also, I have not tried that.
<BR>
