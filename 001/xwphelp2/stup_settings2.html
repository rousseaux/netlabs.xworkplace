<BODY>
<!-- V0.9.9: rewrote this -->
This page allows you to fine-tune the behavior of a single
<A HREF="objects/obj_startshut.html">&xwp; startup folder.</A>
<!-- end V0.9.9 -->

<P>Press <B>"Undo"</B> to restore the settings that were in use before
you opened this notebook page.

<!-- V0.9.9: rewritten all of the following -->
<P>Press <B>"Default"</B> to restore the settings to the installation state.

<P>The following settings are available:

<UL><LI>The <B>"Initial delay"</B> is the time that the startup folder will wait
(after the Desktop has been populated) before it starts processing.

<P><B>Note:</B> This setting affects all &xwp; startup folders.

<P><LI>The  <B>"Per-object delay"</B> specifies how long the startup folder waits
after each object in the folder has been opened. This is different from the default
&os2; startup folder, which starts all contained objects almost at once, frequently
causing WPS hangs at startup.

<P><B>Note:</B> This setting affects all &xwp; startup folders.

<P><LI>If <B>"Show status window"</B> has been checked, you'll get a status window
with a progress bar while the &xwp; startup folder is being processed. That
window also has a "Cancel" button to stop startup processing.

<P><LI>If <B>"Reboot only"</B> is chosen, the folder's contents are only started
when the WPS is started the first time after system bootup. (If you use &xwp;'s
"Restart Desktop" feature, you can override this setting for a Desktop restart.)
This is useful if you have objects in your startup folder which keep running in the
background even if the WPS is restarted.

<P><LI>By contrast, if <B>"Every Desktop restart"</B> is selected, the folder is processed
at every Desktop restart -- that is, even if you have used "Restart Desktop", or if the WPS
restarted because of a crash. This might be useful for starting Desktop objects which
are not in a separate process, such as the &xcenter;.
