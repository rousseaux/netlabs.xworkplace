<!-- V0.9.16: rewrote all the following -->
<P>The &xwp; trash can contains all the objects that you have recently deleted.
This allows you to recover objects that you deleted accidentally.

<P>To delete objects into the trash can, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Drag and drop the objects onto the trash can. In that
respect, the trash can operates similar to a regular folder.

<P><LI>Select the "Delete" menu item for a number of objects that are currently
selected.

<P><LI>Press the "Delete" key on your keyboard to delete the objects that
are currently selected.

</UL>

<IFNDEF __NOXWPSETUP__>
The WPS "Delete" support can be enabled in the
<!-- V0.9.3: link changed -->
<A HREF="objects/obj_xwpsetup.html">"&xwp; Setup" object</A>.
<P>
</IFNDEF>

<!-- end V0.9.16 -->

If you open the trash can (it supports only the Icon and Details views), you can
see all the objects that have been moved into it.
<P>
To <B>restore</B> a trash object, either open its context menu and select
"Restore object", which will move this object back to its original location,
or drag it out of the trash can into any open folder, which will restore the
object in that location instead.
<P>
To <B>permanently delete</B> a trash object, select "Destroy object" from
its context menu.
<P>
<!-- V0.9.4: added this -->
If the trash can is not empty,
<!-- rest as before -->
the trash can's context menu offers you an additional menu item called
<B>"Empty trash can"</B>, which will permanently delete <I>all</I> the objects
which have been moved into the trash can.
