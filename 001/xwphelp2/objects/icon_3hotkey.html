        &xwp;: Object Hotkeys
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<!-- this is all new with V0.9.4 and contains text previously in
     090settings13objinternals.html -->
<BODY>
<!-- V0.9.16: changed the following -->
The entry field at the bottom of the page allows you to define a hotkey for this object.
<IFNDEF __NOXWPSETUP__>
This requires that you have
enabled the "Object hotkeys" feature in the
<!-- V0.9.2: link added -->
<A HREF="objects/obj_xwpsetup.html">"&xwp; Setup" object</A>.
Otherwise the entry field is disabled; this also happens
if the &xwp; hook is not working right. You can check the "Status" page in
"&xwp; Setup" to see if the &xwp; hook has been loaded successfully.
</IFNDEF>

<P>After you have defined an object hotkey, you can always press this hotkey to have
the object opened in its default view (as if you had double-clicked on it).
This works for all objects, that is, folders, files, program objects, settings objects,
and so on.
<!-- end V0.9.16 -->

<P><B>Note:</B> Do not confuse object hotkeys with folder hotkeys, as
displayed in the <!-- V0.9.4: link added -->
<A HREF="objects/obj_wps.html">"Workplace Shell" object.</A>
Object hotkeys are
used to open objects using a key definition and work everywhere, while folder
hotkeys are shortcuts to certain folder commands and work in folders only.
<!-- V0.9.13: removed this See the &xwp;_User_Guide> for an introduction to hotkeys in general. -->

<P>To <B>define an object hotkey,</B> click into the entry field at the bottom of
the page and simply press the key combination which you want to use as the
object hotkey (for example, press <CODE>Ctrl+Alt+C</CODE>). The entry field
will then isplay this key combination.
<!-- V0.9.16: added this phrase -->
Then press the <B>"Set"</B> button to
have the hotkey registered with the object.

<P>To <B>remove an existing object hotkey,</B> press the "Clear" button.

<P>Note that you can view all currently defined object hotkeys at once in the
"Keyboard" settings object, which usually resides in the "System Setup" folder.
<!-- V0.9.16: if the XWPKeyboard class of &xwp; has been installed. &xwp; then
inserts an additional "Hotkeys" page into that object's settings notebook. -->
