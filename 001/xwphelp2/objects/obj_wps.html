<P>The <B>"Workplace Shell" object</B> lets configure Workplace Shell settings
in detail. This object has many notebook pages that deal with Desktop settings
to fine-tune context menus, object and window views, confirmations, and much more.

<IFNDEF __NOXWPSETUP__>
<P>This object has both the notebook pages from the old WPS "System" object that
deal with the WPS, as well as new pages inserted by &xwp;.
Please note that &xwp; only inserts certain pages into the "Workplace Shell"
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>
if you have enabled the corresponding feature on the "Features"
page of the <A HREF="objects/obj_xwpsetup.html">"&xwp; Setup" object</A> first.
This applies, for example, to the
"Sort" and "Hotkeys" pages.
