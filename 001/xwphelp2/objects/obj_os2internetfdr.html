<P>The "Internet" folder is created by &os2; to allow you to
connect to other computers using Internet technology, also
known as TCP/IP.

<P>It contains programs for dialing into an Internet Service Provider (ISP)
and standard Internet utilities such as FTP, ping, and Telnet.
You can also use these utilities for computers in a local area network
(LAN), if they are connected to your computer via TCP/IP as well.
