<P>The "&connectfdr;" folder is created by &os2; to allow you to
connect to other computers on a local area network (LAN).
Such networks are used in both small and large networks and
group computers into domains.

<P>For example, if your computer is part of a company network, you
will probably use LAN technology to be able to see resources from a
central server. But you can also build a small LAN at your own home,
for example to connect your laptop to your desktop machine.
