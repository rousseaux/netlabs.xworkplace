<!-- V0.9.9: rewrote the following -->
&xwp; offers you two special new folders for system startup and shutdown.

<P>The <B>&xwp; Startup Folder</B> is a replacement of the standard
&os2; startup folder. The original continues to work, and both folders can be
used together.

<P>Compared to the Desktop startup folder, the &xwp; startup folders have the
following advantages:

<UL><LI>You can have several startup folders -- the original Desktop startup folder,
and any number of &xwp; startup folders.

<P><LI>For each of the &xwp; startup folders, you can set individually whether
its objects should always be restarted or only after a reboot
in its respective <A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>.

<P><LI>The startup folders can display a progress window while processing the
folder's contents, and you can cancel processing.

<P><LI>You can set initial and per-object delays for the startup folders
in a startup folder's properties notebook.

<!-- end V0.9.9 -->
</UL>By contrast, the <B>&xwp; Shutdown Folder</B> will be executed before
the eXtended Shutdown procedure of &xwp;. By using this folder, you may have
certain tasks executed which you need before switching off your computer.

<P>For a detailed description of these two folders please consult the
<I>&xwp; User Guide.</I>
