<!-- V0.9.13: changed all "XWPString" to "setup string object" -->
A setup string object can store any object setup string and optionally an
object on which that setup string can be invoked per default.

<!-- V0.9.13: added this -->
<!-- V0.9.16: slightly changed -->
<P>See <A HREF="glossary/gls_objstrings.html">"Setup strings"</A> for more
information about WPS setup strings and a list of the most frequently
used ones.

<P>You can invoke the stored setup string on objects in
<!-- V0.0.16: changed two to three -->
three
ways:

<UL><LI>The setup string which is stored in the string object can be invoked
on any object by dropping the target object onto the string object. For example,
if you have an string object which sets folder settings, drop any folder
on the string object, and the folder will be set accordingly.

<P>Note that in this case, it is your responsibility to make sure that the
target object will understand the string. For example, if the string object
contains folder setup strings, it doesn't make sense to invoke the string
on program objects.

<P><LI>Secondly, the string object can optionally store a "default" object on
which the setup string will be invoked when you double-click on the string
object. This might be useful for certain "command" setup strings which should
always be invoked on a certain object.

<!-- V0.9.16: added this -->
<P><LI>Finally, you can put setup string objects into the &xwp; Configuration
Folder to be able to invoke the setup string on any folder.
See <A HREF="menus/menu_3config.html">Configuring context menus</A> for details.
