<P>The <B>"Startup" folder</B> is processed when the system is started.
All objects contained in this folder are opened automatically at
every system startup.

<P>You find this object in the &link_sysfdr; on your Desktop.

<P>By placing &link_progobjs;
into this folder, you can automatically start programs that you
frequently use.

<P>The "Startup" folder is most frequently used with programs that
are to be started during system initialization but might go away shortly
after. For example, a <A HREF="objects/obj_pgmf_batch.html">batch file</A>
that starts a network server or requester is a typical use.
