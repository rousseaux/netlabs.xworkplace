        New XFldDesktop Setup Strings
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<!-- this is all new with V0.9.7 -->
<!-- V0.9.16: moved this to xwphelp dir from inf.001; changed top HTML tag -->
<BODY>
<!-- V0.9.16: replaced this first paragraph -->
If &xwp; is installed, the <CODE>XFldDesktop</CODE> class replaces the
<CODE>WPDesktop</CODE> class and introduces more setup strings.
Since the
Desktop is just a special folder, in addition to the <CODE>XFldDesktop</CODE>
strings listed below, the Desktop also supports the strings of the
<CODE><A HREF="objects/string_1wpobject.html">WPObject</A></CODE>,
<CODE><A HREF="objects/string_2wpfolder.html">WPFolder</A></CODE>,
and <CODE><A HREF="objects/string_3xfolder.html">XFolder</A></CODE> classes.

<P>To get the currently open Desktop, invoke these strings on the object
with the ID <CODE>&lt;WP_DESKTOP&gt;</CODE>.

<DL>
<!-- V0.9.14: SHOWRUNDLG added -->
<DT><P><CITE><B>SHOWRUNDLG</B>=<I>startupdir</I></CITE>
<DD>Shows the &xwp; "Run" dialog, as with the "Run" command from the &xcenter;
<!-- V0.9.16: added entity -->
&xbutton; widget.

<P>If <CITE><I>startupdir</I></CITE> is set to <CITE>DEFAULT</CITE>, the
dialog's entry field for the startup directory will be initially empty
(which means that the
root directory of the boot drive should be used). Any other value will be
used as the initial value for the startup directory.

<P><B>Note 1:</B> This setup string changes no settings,
but is a rather a command to be performed immediately.

<P><B>Note 2:</B> If you invoke this setup string programatically (either through
<CODE>WinSetObjectData</CODE> or <CODE>SysSetObjectData</CODE>),
that function will not return until the dialog has been dismissed.

<P><B>Example:</B> <CITE>SHOWRUNDLG=F:\OS2</CITE> will show the "Run" dialog
with the startup directory field set to <CITE>F:\OS2</CITE>.
<!-- end V0.9.14 -->

<DT><P><CITE><B>XSHUTDOWNNOW</B>=<I>settings</I></CITE>
<DD>Starts &xshutdown; now with the specified <I>settings</I>, which correspond to
the various settings on the "&xshutdown;" page in the Desktop's properties notebook.

<P><B>Note 1:</B> This setup string changes no settings,
but is a rather a command to be performed immediately.
The below <CODE><I>settings</I></CODE> will only affect this one system shutdown.

<P><B>Note 2:</B> If you invoke this setup string programatically (either through
<CODE>WinSetObjectData</CODE> or <CODE>SysSetObjectData</CODE>) and confirmations
are enabled, that function will not return until the confirmation dialog has
been dismissed.

<P><CODE><I>settings</I></CODE> is a comma-separated list of &xshutdown; settings
or <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE>. You can specify any combination of what's listed below.
In general, if one of the keywords below is not specified, &xshutdown; will use
what is specified on the "&xshutdown;" page in the Desktop's properties notebook.

<P>To override the preconfigured behavior after &xshutdown; has completed, use one
of the following:

<UL><LI><CODE>HALT</CODE> will perform a full shutdown and
show the "It is now safe..." message and then
halt the system after shutdown has completed.

<LI><CODE>REBOOT</CODE> will perform a full shutdown and then do a standard reboot.

<LI><CODE>USERREBOOT(<I>cmd</I>)</CODE> will
perform a full shutdown and then
attempt to do a user-defined reboot
with the reboot action <CODE><I>cmd</I></CODE>.

<LI><CODE>POWEROFF</CODE> will
perform a full shutdown and then
attempt an APM power-off, if this is supported on
the system.

<LI><CODE>RESTARTWPS</CODE> will not shut down the system, but only restart the
WPS.

<LI><CODE>FULLRESTARTWPS</CODE> will not shut down the system, but only restart the
WPS, but close all open sessions first and reuse the &xwp; startup folder at
the next Desktop startup.

</UL><BR>To override the preconfigured treatment of VIO windows,
use either <CODE>AUTOCLOSEVIO</CODE> or <CODE>NOAUTOCLOSEVIO</CODE>.

<P>To override the preconfigured setting for <CODE>XSHUTDWN.LOG</CODE>,
use either <CODE>LOG</CODE> or <CODE>NOLOG</CODE>.

<P>To override the preconfigured animation settings, use either
<CODE>ANIMATE</CODE> or <CODE>NOANIMATE</CODE>.

<P>To override the preconfigured confirmation setting, use either
<CODE>CONFIRM</CODE> or <CODE>NOCONFIRM</CODE>. Note that if confirmations are on
(either because <CODE>CONFIRM</CODE> was specified or because it was preconfigured
and not overridden), most of the settings specified with <CODE>XSHUTDOWNNOW</CODE>
will only cause the confirmation dialog to display different defaults.

<P>If you do not want to override any settings, specify <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE>.

<P>Examples:

<BR><UL><LI><CODE>XSHUTDOWNNOW=DEFAULT</CODE> will start &xshutdown; with the current
settings.

<P><LI><CODE>XSHUTDOWNNOW=RESTARTWPS,NOCONFIRM,LOG</CODE> will restart the WPS now
without confirmation, but enable logging this one time.
