<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.16 -->
<BODY>
The second "Icon" page exists only in properties notebooks of folder objects
and allows you to change a folder's <B>animation icon.</B>

<IFNDEF __NOXWPSETUP__>
<P>&xwp; replaces the WPS's original "Icon" pages with a new, enhanced version if
you have enabled the respective setting on the "Features" page in the
<A HREF="objects/obj_xwpsetup.html">"&xwp; Setup" object</A>. Disable that setting
to get the original page back.
</IFNDEF>

<P>The <B>animation icon</B> is displayed for a folder object if the folder
currently has an open view. By default, folders have an "open folder" animation
which makes it more obvious that the folder is currently open, but you can
change this animation icon to anything else.

<P>Press <B>"Undo"</B> to restore the settings
that were in use before you opened this notebook page.
<P>Press <B>"Default"</B> to restore the folder's animation icon
to default values, which are normally determined by the object's
<A HREF="glossary/gls_wpsclasses.html">class</A>.

<P>The "Current icon" field works exactly as with the respective field
on the first "Icon" page, except that it only influences the <I>animation</I>
icon of the folder. See <A HREF="objects/icon_0icon.html">Current icon</A> for
more instructions.
