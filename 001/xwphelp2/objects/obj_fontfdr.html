The "&xwp; Font Folder" is a special folder which shows you all fonts which are
currently installed on your system.

<P>It is recommended to always open the font folder in details view, because only
then you can see all the additional data the font folder can display for your fonts.
If the font folder does not display font details correctly, set its "details class"
to "Installed font" on the respective "View" page in the font folder's
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>.

<P>The font folder has the following special features:

<OL><LI>When it is first opened, it will <B>collect all fonts</B> which are currently
installed on your system and display them as <A HREF="objects/obj_fontobj.html">font objects</A>.
Font objects have a special <A HREF="font_view.html">sample view</A> which
allows you to take a look at the font.

<P><LI>You can quickly <B>install fonts</B> by dragging
<A HREF="objects/obj_fontfile.html">font files</A> onto the open font folder.

<P><LI>You can quickly <B>deinstall fonts</B> by selecting "Deinstall" from a font
object's context menu.

</OL>Note: The font folder is not intended to be used as a regular folder. Do not put
regular objects into it. The only files you may drag into the font folder are
font files.
