        "Icon" Page: Current Icon
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<!-- this is all new with V0.9.16 -->
<BODY>
The "Current icon" field displays what icon (picture) is currently used
to display the object in open
<!-- V0.9.19: added link -->
<A HREF="objects/obj_fdr_main.html">folders</A>.

<P>Unless you have modified the object's icon, the default icon for the
object is usually determined from the object's
<A HREF="glossary/gls_wpsclasses.html">WPS class</A>.
<!-- V0.9.19: added this -->
In other words, most objects have a default icon. Howver, you
can replace this icon on this page.

<P>To modify the object's icon, do one of the following:

<UL><LI><B>Drag and drop</B> an icon file (usually with an <CODE>.ICO</CODE>
file name extension) into the "Current icon" field.

<!-- V0.9.19: added this -->
<P><LI><B>Drag and drop</B> any other WPS object into the "Current icon"
field. That will copy the icon from the object that was dropped.

<P><LI>Push one of the <B>buttons</B> next to the icon display.

</UL>The following action buttons are available:

<UL><LI><B>"Edit icon"</B> will start the &os2; Icon Editor application with
the current icon of the object. You can then modify the icon. If you save
the icon with the Icon Editor, the object will pick up the change.

<P><LI><B>"Browse"</B> will open a standard &os2; file dialog which allows
you to find a new <CODE>.ICO</CODE> file to use for the object.

<P><LI><B>"Reset icon"</B> will reset the object's icon to its default, which
is determined by its <A HREF="glossary/gls_wpsclasses.html">WPS class</A>. The button is
disabled if the object is already using the class default icon.

</UL>Note that <B>folder objects</B> usually have a second "Icon" page after
this page, which allows you to change the folder's animation icon.
