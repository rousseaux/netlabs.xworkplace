<BODY>
A program file is a special kind of
<A HREF="objects/obj_dataf.html">data file</A>
that contains executable code for your computer.

<P>This program file is a library. It cannot be executed separately, but
its executable code is instead used by another program.

<P>The <CODE>.DLL</CODE> file extension stands for "Dynamic Link Library"
which means that the code in the module is only loaded when some application
demands it. In addition, several applications can share the code from the
DLL, which saves both disk space and your computer's main memory.

<P>DLLs can either come with the operating system or with an application.
The system code of &os2; itself is largely contained in DLL files, too.
