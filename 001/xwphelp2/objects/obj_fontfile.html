If the <A HREF="objects/obj_fontfdr.html">Fonts folder</A> is installed,
&xwp; will automatically make all data files which appear to be font files
on your system "font files".

<P>Font files do not behave much differently from regular data files... except
for the following:

<UL><LI>They automatically receive a default file type of "Font file".

<P><LI>If no associations exist for that type (or the file's extension), font files
receive a different default icon.

<P><LI>Only font files can be dropped onto the Fonts folder in order to
allow you to quickly install fonts.

</UL>Presently, files with the following extensions will be turned into font files:

<UL><LI><CODE>.TTF</CODE>, <CODE>.TTC</CODE>: These are the extensions for TrueType
font files. It is assumed that your &os2; system can display TrueType fonts. This is
the case for Warp 4 (and higher) without any special preparations. On Warp 3, you have
to install the FreeType/2 engine -- but this is recommended for Warp 4 as well because
its display quality is better.

<P><LI><CODE>.OFM</CODE>: These are the special files which make Adobe Type-1
fonts (with the <CODE>.PFB</CODE> extension) accessible to &os2;. In order for &os2;
to be able to install a Type-1 font file, you need both an <CODE>.OFM</CODE> and
a <CODE>.PFB</CODE> file, but only the <CODE>.OFM</CODE> file will actually be
stored in the system's font registry (and therefore only the <CODE>.OFM</CODE> file
is turned into an &xwp; font file).

<P><LI><CODE>.FON</CODE> files represent bitmap fonts. Even though these are properly
listed in the Fonts folder, there may be problems with the sample view of these files.
