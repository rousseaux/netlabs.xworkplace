<!-- V0.9.16: replace XFolder with &xwp; -->
<BODY>
The &xwp; &cfgfdr; looks just like any folder, but is used by &xwp;
to determine additional menu items for all folder &popmenu;s. All objects that
you put into this folder will result in the creation of additional &popmenu;
items.

<P>See <A HREF="menus/menu_3config.html">Configuring &popmenu;s</A> for
instructions about how to change the default setup.
