<BODY>
The &xwp; Configuration Folder looks just like any folder, but is used by &xwp;
to determine additional menu items for all folder context menus. All objects that
you put into this folder will result in the creation of additional context menu
items.

<P>See <A HREF="menus/menu_3config.html">Configuring context menus</A> for
instructions about how to change the default setup.
