<BODY>
An open

view window has the following components:

<P><IMG SRC="img/folderview.gif">

<!-- V0.9.20: replaced this -->
See <A HREF="glossary/gls_objmouse.html">"Object mouse operations"</A> for how to work with objects.
<!-- end V0.9.20: rewrote this -->

<P>There are three different folder views: Icon, Tree and Details view.

<UL><LI>The <B>Icon view</B> allows you to freely position the objects
in the folder, as shown in the above picture.
For example, the Desktop itself is displayed in Icon view
by default. You can
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_dragdrop.html">drag and drop</A>
the objects within the view to reposition them.
(Alternatively, you can select that the Icon view should display the
icons sorted, arranged, gridded, in a single column or in multiple columns
by selecting the respective command from the folder's "View" menu.)

<P><LI>The <B>Tree view</B> shows the folder together with its subfolders
in a hierarchical view, where you can expand the subfolders or open them
to have their contents displayed in turn.
<!-- V0.9.20: rewrote this phrase -->
<P>In the &link_drivesfdr;, if you click on a drive object, it will
normally open in a Tree view.

<P><LI>The <B>Details view</B> shows all the objects in the folder in
a detailed list, where you can look at all the object properties such
as the creation date and time and size.
