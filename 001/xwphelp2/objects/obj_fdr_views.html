An open folder view window has the following components:

<P><IMG SRC="img/folderview.gif">

<P>To open the
<A HREF="glossary/gls_popmenu.html">&popmenu;</A> of a contained
object, click on the object with mouse button 2. Note that if several
objects are selected and you clicked on one of the selected objects,
the selection will apply to all selected objects.
Alternatively, click on the empty space in the folder container
to open the &popmenu; for the folder itself.

<P>There are three different folder views: Icon, Tree and Details view.

<UL><LI>The <B>Icon view</B> allows you to freely position the objects
in the folder, as shown in the above picture.
For example, the Desktop itself is displayed in Icon view
per default. You can drag and drop the objects within the view to reposition
them.
(Alternatively, you can select that the Icon view should display the
icons sorted, arranged, gridded, in a single column or in multiple columns
by selecting the respective command from the folder's "View" menu.)

<P><LI>The <B>Tree view</B> shows the folder together with its subfolders
in a hierarchical view, where you can expand the subfolders or open them
to have their contents displayed in turn. Tree views are most frequently
opened when you double-click on a disk object in the "Drives" folder.

<P><LI>The <B>Details view</B> shows all the objects in the folder in
a detailed list, where you can look at all the object properties such
as the creation date and time and size.

</UL>&xwp; allows you to <B>configure folder views</B> in great detail.
In general, you can modify view settings in the following places:

<UL><LI>The
<A HREF="objects/obj_wps.html">"Workplace Shell" object</A> has
many options which will affect view settings globally, i.e. for
all objects on the system.

<P><LI>By contrast, you can modify the settings for an individual
folder in its own
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>.

</UL>Some of the available view settings are:

<UL><LI>You can disable the folder <B>menu bar</B> or the <B>status bar</B>
either in the "View" menu, or on the "Menu" and "View" pages in the folder
properties, or globally on the "Menu" and "Status bar" pages in the
"Workplace Shell" notebook.

<P><LI>You can disable many menu items on the "Menu" pages in the
"Workplace Shell" notebook, if you find all the options confusing.

</UL> Note that you can
<A HREF="glossary/gls_dropfonts.html">drag and drop fonts and colors</A>
onto any status bar.
