An &xwp; "font object" represents a <A HREF="objects/obj_fontfile.html">font file</A>
which is currently installed.
Such a font object can only appear in the open
<A HREF="objects/obj_fontfdr.html">Fonts folder</A>.

<P><B>Note:</B> In this context, the term "font" refers to a <B>font face,</B>
which is physically represented by a font file.
For most fonts, each font family is represented by several faces. For example, for the
"Times New Roman" family, you will have four font files (one for "Regular", "Bold",
"Italics", and "Bold Italics", respectively). Only if no face is found for a certain
format (for example, if you want bold text in a word processor, but no bold face exists
for the current font), &os2; will imitate bold and italic formats in its own graphics
engine, which in most cases will look quite ugly.

<P>Even though most applications (and the standard &os2; font dialog as well) will only
enumerate the various font family name and automatically find the correct font file for
a format that has been selected, the Fonts folder will list all installed faces
separately. You can see the respective families in the Fonts folder's details view however.

<P>You can <B>install fonts</B> into the system by
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_dragdrop.html">dragging</A>
<A HREF="objects/obj_fontfile.html">font files</A> and dropping them into an
open Fonts folder. Reversely, you can
<B>uninstall a font</B> by selecting "Uninstall" from a font object's &popmenu;, after
you have opened the Fonts folder.

<P>Font objects have a special "Sample" view, which is opened when you double click
on a font object. See <A HREF="font_view.html">Font sample view</A> for details.
