<P>The <B>"&os2; Kernel" object</B> lets you configure some rather internal
&os2; settings.
This object has
<!-- V0.9.2: removed this
those settings pages from the old "System"
object which deal with &os2; internals, as well as
-->
lots of new notebook pages
inserted by &xwp;, which allow you to change &cfgsys;
settings more easily.

<!-- V0.9.16: See the &xwp; User Guide for an overview of the &xwp; settings
objects. -->

<!-- V0.9.20: rewrote this paragraph -->
<P>This object resides in the &link_syssetupfdr;.
Open the Desktop's <A HREF="glossary/gls_popmenu.html">&popmenu;</A> and select
"&syssetup;" to have that folder opened quickly.
