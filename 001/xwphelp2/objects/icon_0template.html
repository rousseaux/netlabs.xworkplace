<!-- this is all new with V0.9.16 -->
<BODY>
The "Template" check box determines if the current object is a template
for creating other objects.

<P>If you <B>check</B> the "Template" setting, the object becomes a template.
The object's icon then changes, and you can then drag a copy off the object to
create another object from it which has exactly the same settings as the
template object. You should only enable this setting if you want to use this
object exclusively for creating other objects from it.

<P>&os2; has a number of standard template objects in the "Templates" folder
which allow you to create new objects for the most commonly used object types.
However, it is not a requirement that all templates reside in this "Templates"
folder; templates can reside anywhere on the system.

<P>If the "Template" setting is <B>unchecked,</B> the object behaves as usual.

<P>Note that the "Template" check box will be <B>disabled</B> for certain types
of objects that cannot be duplicated.
