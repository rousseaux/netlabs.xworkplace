<BODY>
The <B>"Title"</B> field displays the name of the object.
This name is displayed in folders together with the icon.
Simply type in this field to change the object's title.

<P>Your new title can be displayed on one or more
lines below the icon.  Press the Enter key as you
type a new title to indicate the start of a new line.
You can use any characters, including spaces, except
the backslash (\).

<P>If the object represents a physical file or a folder on
a disk, changing the title will also change the object's
file name ("real name").
Depending on the
<A HREF="glossary/gls_fs.html">file system</A> the object resides in,
certain restrictions apply. See
<A HREF="glossary/gls_realnames.html">"Real names"</A> for details.
