<BODY>
If a diskette is write-protected, it can only be read from
and its data cannot be changed.

<P>Diskette write protection is performed by the drive's hardware,
so there is no way to circumvent it from software. Write-protect your
diskettes in order not to accidentally delete important
data or to prevent malicious software such as viruses from
infecting the diskette.

<P>A 3.5-inch
diskette can be write-protected by sliding a built-in
tab to reveal the write-protect hole.
A 5.25-inch diskette has a write-protect notch
located on the right side of the diskette. You can
place a write-protect tab over the notch to protect
the information stored on the diskette.

<P>To store information on a write-protected diskette,
you must slide the tab back over the
write-protect hole on a 3.5-inch diskette, or
remove the write-protect tab from the
5.25-inch diskette.

<P>If a diskette does not have a write-protect notch or
tab, the diskette is permanently write protected.
Software manufacturers typically use permanently
write-protected diskettes to prevent the information
on the diskettes from being accidentally changed or
deleted.
