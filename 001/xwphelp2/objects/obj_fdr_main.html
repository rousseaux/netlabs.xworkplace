<BODY>
Folders are objects that contain other
objects. This makes them different from all other objects in the
Workplace Shell. They can, for example, contain
<A HREF="objects/obj_dataf.html">data files</A> or other folders.

<P>Every folder corresponds to a directory on disk. The nested directory
structure on a disk is represented by a matching folder hierarchy.

<P>If you double-click on a folder object, a <B>folder view</B>
is opened, which displays all the objects that reside in the folder.
There are
<A HREF="objects/obj_fdr_views.html">three different folder views</A>:
Icon, Tree and Details view.
To specifically  which one is opened, instead of double-clicking on the
folder, open its
<A HREF="glossary/gls_popmenu.html">&popmenu;</A>
and select the view from the "Open" menu.
