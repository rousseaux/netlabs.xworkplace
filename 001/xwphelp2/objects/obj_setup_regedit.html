The <B>"Registry Editor"</B> allows you to look at the system registry.

<P>This object resides in the &link_syssetupfdr;.
Open the Desktop's <A HREF="glossary/gls_popmenu.html">&popmenu;</A> and select
"&syssetup;" to have that folder opened quickly.

<P>The <B>system registry</B> is a central database that &os2; provides
for applications to conveniently store persistant data. &os2; also uses this
database itself to store system configuration and the state of the Desktop
between reboots.

<P>The system registry is composed of the <CODE>OS2.INI</CODE>,
<CODE>OS2SYS.INI</CODE>, <CODE>USER.DAT</CODE>, and <CODE>SYSTEM.DAT</CODE>
files.

<P>You can also use the Registry Editor to add, change, or delete key and
values in the registry. However, you should take great care when doing so
because much of the registry is critical to the system's operation, and
making invalid changes can render your entire system unusable.
