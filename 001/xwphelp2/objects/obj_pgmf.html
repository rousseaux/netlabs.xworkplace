A program file is a special kind of <A HREF="objects/obj_dataf.html">data file</A>
that contains executable code for your computer.

<P>If the program file has a <CODE>.COM</CODE>, <CODE>.EXE</CODE>, <CODE>.CMD</CODE>,
or <CODE>.BAT</CODE> extension, &os2; can most likely execute it. In those cases,
you can simply double-click on the program file to start it. However, if you do
not know exactly what the program does, you should be cautious in doing so.

<P>Note also that the recommended way to start applications in &os2; is
to create program objects for them. To do this, do one of the following:

<OL><LI>Drag a new program object from the respective template in the
"Templates" folder
<IFNDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
in the "System" folder
</IFNDEF>
on your Desktop, and fill in the data in the program's
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>.

<P><LI>Even more simply, drag the program file to an open folder (or the
Desktop). This will create a new program object for the program file with
the program data already set.

</OL>Program files are usually written for a specific operating system. If
the program file was not specifically written for &os2;, &os2; can still
execute it if it is a 16-bit Windows executable or a DOS program.

<P>If you have Odin installed, you can even run many 32-bit Windows
programs.
