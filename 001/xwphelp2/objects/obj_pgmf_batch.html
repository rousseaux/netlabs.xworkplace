<P>Batch and command files, or <B>"scripts",</B> are plain text files that contain
a series of <A HREF="glossary/gls_cmd.html">commands for a command processor.</A>
They are processed in sequence when the file is executed.

<P>Batch and command files are executed by a command processor. Which one is used
depends on the file extension:

<UL><LI>If the extension is <CODE>.CMD</CODE> <B>(command file),</B> it is run
via the &os2; command processor, <CODE>CMD.EXE</CODE>.
The file is assumed to be a sequence of commands, unless it starts with a REXX
comment (<CODE>/* ... */</CODE>). In that case, it is interpreted
as a <A HREF="glossary/gls_cmd_rexx.html">REXX</A> script.

<P><LI>Files with the <CODE>.BAT</CODE> extension <B>(batch files)</B> are run
in <A HREF="glossary/gls_sessions.html">DOS sessions</A>
via the DOS command processor, <CODE>COMMAND.COM</CODE>.
Note that the &os2; command processor (<CODE>CMD.EXE</CODE>) recognizes the
<CODE>.BAT</CODE> file extension as well. If you are at a command prompt
and enter the name of a <CODE>.BAT</CODE> file, it will automatically launch a
DOS session.

</UL>Batch and command files are useful to automate tasks. For example, if
you find yourself entering the same sequence of commands over and over at a
command prompt, you can put that sequence in a batch or command file and execute
that script instead to save yourself time.
You can create such files with any text editor, for example, the &os2; &eexe;.

<P>Note that once you have created a batch or command file, you can
also start it from the Workplace Shell. You can also create
&link_progobjs; for batch or
command files.
