sort functions are configured on the
"Sort" notebook pages.

<P>The "Sort" page appears in two different locations:

<OL><LI>The "Sort" page in the
&link_wpsobj;
allows you to specify global sort settings, which apply to all folders,
unless you specify something different for a certain folder.

<P>For example, you can enable "Always maintain sort order" on for all folders.

<P><LI>&xwp; also replaces the default &os2; "Sort" page in every
<B>folder properties notebook</B>. On this page you may override the default
settings which you have specified in the "Workplace Shell" object.

</OL>The <B>list box</B> on the "Sort" notebook pages lets you select the
<A HREF="fsys/fldr_sortdef.html">default sort criterion</A> for
a certain folder (or, in the "Workplace Shell" notebook, for all folders).

<P>If <B>"Folders first"</B> is enabled, all subfolders are sorted
to the top of the folder. See
<A HREF="fsys/fldr_sortcrit.html">"Sort Criteria"</A> for a detailed
description.

<P>If <B>"Always maintain sort order"</B> is enabled, the folder
will always be sorted according to the
<A HREF="fsys/fldr_sortdef.html">default sort criterion</A>.
