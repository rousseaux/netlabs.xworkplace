This message appears when you have attempted to delete an object, but the
<A HREF="objects/obj_trash.html">&xwp; trash can</A> could not be found.

<P>This can have the following reasons:

<UL><LI>The trash can was deleted for some reason. This is not easy
to accomplish because the trash can protects itself against deletion,
but still, it is possible.

<P><LI>The trash can has lost its <A HREF="glossary/gls_objids.html">object ID</A>.
To find its trash can, &xwp; looks for an object with the ID
<CODE>&lt;XWP_TRASHCAN&gt;</CODE>.

<P><LI>Another object which is not the &xwp; trash can has the object ID
<CODE>&lt;XWP_TRASHCAN&gt;</CODE>.

</UL>In any case, it is safe to press "Yes" to have a new trash can created on
your Desktop.
