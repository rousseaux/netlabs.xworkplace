<BODY>
Before using the &xwp; Shell boot logo feature, please read the introduction in the
<I>&xwp; User Guide,</I> which has important information to be
considered when using boot logos, especially with the "transparent"
style.
<P>If the <B>"Enable boot logo"</B> check box is not checked, &xwp;
will simply skip the boot logo processing. You can also temporarily
disable the boot logo in case of trouble by holding down the <B>"Shift"</B>
key at Desktop startup.
<P>If that checkbox is checked however, you may select an OS/2 1.3 <CODE>.BMP</CODE>
file to be used as a boot logo. Pressing the <B>"Browse"</B> button will
open a standard "Open file" dialog, while <B>"Test logo"</B> will
display the logo on the screen for a few seconds to enable you to check
your settings without having to restart the WPS.
<P>&xwp; offers you two different <B>boot logo styles:</B>
<BR><UL><LI><B>"Transparent style"</B> means that all those pixels of the bitmap will be
made transparent that have the same color as the pixel in the most lower-left
corner of the bitmap. Again, please mind the notes in the
<I>&xwp; User Guide</I> before using your own transparent bitmaps, because
this feature is extremely CPU-intensive. The bitmaps shipped in the
<CODE>bootlogo</CODE> subdirectory of the &xwp; installation directory should
be working though.
<P><LI><B>"Blow-up style"</B> is the old boot logo style of XFolder V0.84 and before.
This has been re-introduced because many users asked for it.
