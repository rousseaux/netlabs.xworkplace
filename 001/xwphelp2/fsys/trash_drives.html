<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.4 -->
<BODY>
On this can you can tell &xwp; which drives should be supported by the trash can.
<!-- V0.9.16: See the <I>&xwp; User Guide</I> for an introduction to the trash can
functionality. -->

<P>Press <B>"Undo"</B> to restore the settings
that were in use before you opened this notebook page.
<P>Press <B>"Default"</B> to restore the settings
to the installation state. This will re-scan drives (see the note below).

<P>A drive is <B>"supported"</B> by the trash can if it appears in the right list box.
This means that the trash can will accept objects from this drive.

<P>A drive is <B>"unsupported"</B> by the trash can if it appears in the left list box.
The trash can will then refuse to accept objects from this drive and only allow you to
"truly" delete objects from this drive (i.e. the operation cannot be undone).

<P>Even though they are not listed on this page, drives A: and B: are always unsupported.

<!-- V0.9.13: added JFS -->
<P>The trash can has been extensively tested with the FAT, HPFS, and JFS
<!-- V0.9.19: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_fs.html">file systems,</A>
which
are supported by &os2; by default. You should be careful to use the trash can with other file
systems which are supplied by third parties, especially if these file systems do not support
hidden directories or extended attributes. Great care should be taken with the EXT2FS (Linux)
and VFAT (Windows 95) file systems, if you have drivers for those installed.

<!-- V0.9.19: removed this
See "File systems"</A> for introductory information about file systems. -->

<P><B>Note:</B> Problems have been encountered with the <CODE>VFAT.IFS</CODE>
driver by Daniel Steiner because apparently that driver doesn't support hidden
directories very well. You should disable support for those drives.
<!-- end V0.9.19 -->

<P>To <B>change</B> the trash can support for a drive, select it from the left or right
list box and press the "Add" or "Remove" button.

<P><B>Note:</B> If drive letters have changed since the trash can has been initially
installed, this is not automatically reflected by this page. To have all drives rescanned,
press the "Default" button and reconfigure drive support.
