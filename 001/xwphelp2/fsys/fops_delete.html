<BODY>
Use the "Delete" menu item to remove the selected objects from a
<A HREF="objects/obj_fdr_main.html">folder</A>.

<P>Per default, selecting "Delete" will not instantly destroy the object yet,
but move it into the <A HREF="objects/obj_trash.html">&xwp; trash can</A> instead.
This allows you
to recover the object if you accidentally selected "Delete".
To permanently destroy all objects that have been moved into the trash can,
select the "Empty trash can" menu item from the trash can's
<!-- V0.9.19: link added -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_popmenu.html">&popmenu;</A>.

<P>As a shortcut, you can also press the "Delete" key on your keyboard to
have the selected objects deleted.

<P>If you want to <B>immediately delete</B> the selected objects, without
moving them to the trash can first, hold down the <B>"Shift" key</B> when
selecting the "Delete" menu item or pressing the "Delete" key. Be warned
that this operation normally cannot be undone: the selected objects are
destroyed for good.

<P><B>Notes:</B>

<UL><LI>Depending on the settings on the "Confirmations" page
in the <A HREF="objects/obj_wps.html">"Workplace Shell" object</A>,
&xwp; will display a confirmation message before permanently deleting
objects.

<P><LI>If you prefer to always immediately delete objects, instead
of moving them to the trash can first, enable the respective setting
on the first properties page in the trash can's
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>.

<P><LI>There are ways to recover file-system objects that have been
accidentally deleted with the use of the
<CODE>UNDELETE</CODE> command on the
&os2; command line. However, this requires that support for this be enabled
first. See the
<A HREF="cmdref.inf#undelete">documentation of the <CODE>UNDELETE</CODE> command</A>
in the <I>&os2; Command Reference</I>.

in the
