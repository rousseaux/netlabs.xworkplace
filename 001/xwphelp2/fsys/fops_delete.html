Use the "Delete" menu item to remove the selected objects from a folder.

<P>Per default, selecting "Delete" will not instantly destroy the object yet,
but move it into the <A HREF="objects/obj_trash.html">&xwp; trash can</A> instead.
This allows you
to recover the object if you accidentally selected "Delete".
To permanently destroy all objects that have been moved into the trash can,
select the "Empty trash can" menu item from the trash can's context menu.

<P>As a shortcut, you can also press the "Delete" key on your keyboard to
have the selected objects deleted.

<P>If you want to <B>permanently destroy</B> the object immediately, without
moving it to the trash can first, hold down the <B>"Shift" key</B> when
selecting the "Delete" menu item or pressing the "Delete" key. Be warned
that this operation normally cannot be undone: the selected objects are
destroyed for good.

<P>Depending on the settings on the "Confirmations" page
in the <A HREF="objects/obj_wps.html">"Workplace Shell" object</A>,
&xwp; will display a confirmation message before permanently deleting
objects.

<P>Note that there are ways to recover file-system objects that have been
accidentally deleted with the use of the
<CODE>UNDELETE</CODE> command on the
&os2; command line. However, this requires that support for this is enabled
first. See the
<A HREF="cmdref.inf#undelete">documentation of the <CODE>UNDELETE</CODE> command</A>
in the <I>&os2; Command Reference</I>.

<IFNDEF __NOXWPSETUP__>
<P>You can disable &xwp;'s delete replacements on the "Features" page
in the
<A HREF="objects/obj_xwpsetup.html">"&xwp; Setup" object</A>.
The above description applies to the case where you have both "Replace true delete"
and the &xwp; trash can enabled. If you only enable the trash can, the WPS
will still perform the permanent destruction when the "Shift" key is pressed.
If you only enable "Replace true delete", all delete operations will be
performed without moving the objects into the trash can first.
