The <B>"Information"</B> fields allow you to specify additional information
about this file in the file's extended attributes. Initially, all these fields are
empty; you may set this to any information you like.
<!-- V0.9.16 Note that the "Version" field
(which is displayed by the WPS's original "File" page 3) has been dropped because
I have never seen any application use that information. -->

<UL><LI>The <B>"Subject"</B> field can contain a brief summary of the purpose of this
file. This is limited to
<!-- V0.9.2: fixed number -->
260 characters.
<P><LI>The <B>"Comments"</B> field can contain miscellanous notes on the file, for
example restrictions, requirements, or any other information.

<P><LI>The <B>"Keywords"</B> field was designed to contain key text phrases which
can identify the file in searches of, for example, database applications.
<!-- V0.9.16 Personally,
I have never seen an application use this information, but who knows. -->
