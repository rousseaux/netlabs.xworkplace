If <B>"Enable NumLock at startup"</B> is checked, &xwp; will
automatically turn on the "NumLock" key on the numeric keyboard while the
Desktop is starting up. Changing this setting will also enable/disable NumLock
immediately, just for fun. The "NumLock" key can still be disabled manually,
of course.
<P>Note that this setting will only affect all programs running in the
Presentation Manager (PM) session (PM programs, the WPS itself, &os2;
windows). It will not affect &os2; full-screen sessions, DOS windows and
full-screen sessions, or any &winos2; session.
