        Status Bars: Additional File-System Object Codes
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<!-- V0.9.13: This is an almost exact copy of the file with the same name
     from the 001\inf.001 directory. The status bar code descriptions
     were simply moved from the INF to the HLP file.
     Only the following things were changed:
        --  HTML tag on top;
        --  class reference below was removed.
     The following change notes specify changes to the original
     file that was in 001\inf.001. -->

<!-- This file is all new with V0.84 and contains the status bar codes
     previously described in fldr_32statusbars.html. Nothing else has changed. -->
<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: see notes below -->
<BODY>
<!-- V0.9.0: add the following line -->
<!-- V0.9.13: removed this -- Class: XFolder -->
<!-- V0.9.16: replace XFolder with &xwp; -->
<B>File-system objects</B> (WPFileSystem class, i.e. folders and data files)
support the following <I>additional</I> codes:
<BR><DL>
<DT><CITE>  $r  1)  </CITE><DD>object's "real name"
<DT><CITE>  $y  1)  </CITE><DD>object type (.TYPE Extended Attribute)
<DT><CITE>  $a  1)  </CITE><DD>object filesystem attributes; this will insert four
characters ("ahrs") for the archived, hidden, read-only and system filesystem attributes,
with the ones capitalized which are set for a file (e.g. "Ahrs")
<DT><CITE>  $D  1)  </CITE><DD>object last write date
<DT><CITE>  $T  1)  </CITE><DD>object last write time
<DT><CITE>  $Eb 1,2)</CITE><DD>Extended Attributes size in bytes
<DT><CITE>  $Ek 1,2)</CITE><DD>Extended Attributes size in kBytes, i.e. bytes / 1000
<DT><CITE>  $EK 1,2)</CITE><DD>Extended Attributes size in KBytes, i.e. bytes / 1024
<!-- V0.9.6: added the following two -->
<DT><CITE>  $Ea 1,2)</CITE><DD>Extended Attributes size in bytes/kBytes;
this automatically chooses an optimal scale depending on the number
<DT><CITE>  $EA 1,2)</CITE><DD>Extended Attributes size in bytes/KBytes;
this automatically chooses an optimal scale depending on the number
</DL>
<BR><B>Notes:</B>
<P>1) These codes will only display the data which is held in the internal WPS buffers.
This means when this data changes, e.g. because a file has been altered by some other
program, the status bar information will only change when the WPS buffer data is
refreshed, for example if you select "Refresh now".
<P>2) The WPS has always had a bug due to which an extended attribute size larger than 32767 will
always return 32767, although a size of 64 KB is technically possible.
As a result, &xwp; will also display this wrong value.
