        Status Bars: Additional Disk Object Codes
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<!-- V0.9.13: This is an almost exact copy of the file with the same name
     from the 001\inf.001 directory. The status bar code descriptions
     were simply moved from the INF to the HLP file.
     Only the following things were changed:
        --  HTML tag on top;
        --  class reference below was removed.
     The following change notes specify changes to the original
     file that was in 001\inf.001. -->

<!-- This file is all new with V0.84 and contains the status bar codes
     previously described in fldr_32statusbars.html. Nothing else has changed. -->
<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: see notes below -->
<BODY>
<!-- V0.9.0: add the following line -->
<!-- V0.9.13: removed this -- Class: XFolder -->
<B>Disk objects</B> (WPDisk class, i.e. the objects in the "Drives" folder)
support the following codes <I>in addition</I> to the codes for all objects:
<BR><DL>
<!-- V0.9.13: replaced the following -->
<DT><CITE>  $f<I>X</I>     </CITE><DD>free space on the drive
<DT><CITE>  $z<I>X</I>     </CITE><DD>total size of the drive

<P>In the above two, <CODE><I>X</I></CODE> is a
special <A HREF="fsys/stat_99format.html">format specifier</A> character.
<!-- end V0.9.13 rewrite -->

<BR><DT><CITE>  $F      </CITE><DD>file-system type (FAT, HPFS, JFS, CDFS, ...)

<BR><DT><CITE>  $L      </CITE><DD>disk label
</DL>

<BR><B>Notes:</B>
<!-- V0.9.13: removed this If you are using these keys, you should make sure that you have
&os2;'s hardware error messages disabled, because otherwise you'll get a
"drive not ready" message every time no disk is inserted.
The new "&os2; Kernel"
object lets you do this on the "Errors" page. -->

<!-- V0.9.11: changed the following line -->
<P>The <CITE>$f</CITE> and <CODE>$z</CODE> codes are <I>redefined</I>
for disk objects. Normally, they display the space on the drive on which the
<I>folder</I> resides, which, for the "Drives" folder, would of course always return
the same value for the drive on which your Desktop resides.
Thus this code has been redefined for drive objects.
