<BODY>
In this window you may select the object class for which you wish to set
status bar information when only one object is selected in a folder.

<P>This window shows you all the installed
<!-- V0.9.13: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_wpsclasses.html">WPS classes</A>
to give you an overview
about which class is derived from which.

<P>For determining status bar codes however you may only select a class which
can process this information. Such classes are printed in black, while classes
which don't support this appear in gray and cannot be selected.

<!-- V0.9.0: added the following -->
<P>The tree view has been extended so that all classes which support status bar
information are initially visible.

<!-- V0.9.0: added the following -->
<!-- V0.9.13: moved this down
Note that status bar information is independent of the additional
&xwp; classes. That is, it is not only &xwp; classes which support
status bar information, but on the other hand, not all &xwp; classes
support this either. -->

<P>The generic status bar information is determined by the class <B>XFldObject.</B>
That is, if you select a single object for which no class defines more specific status
bar information (an example for this would be a printer object), the codes of
the XFldObject class are used.

<!-- V0.9.0: changed the following -->
<P>More specific keys are however provided by the classes <B>XFldDisk</B>
(for "disk" objects, as in the "Drives" folder), <B>WPProgram</B> (for abstract
program objects), <B>WPFileSystem</B> (for folders and data files), and <B>WPUrl</B>.
<!-- V0.9.19: removed this (for URL objects, which exist on Warp 4 only). -->

<!-- V0.9.13: begin moved text -->
<P>Note that status bar information is <I>independent</I> of the additional
&xwp; classes. That is, it is not only &xwp; classes which support
status bar information, but on the other hand, not all &xwp; classes
support this either.
<!-- V0.9.13: removed this
Please look into the &xwp;_User_Guide to see a complete list
of all the different codes for the different classes, which are too complex to
be shown here. -->
