<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.9 -->
<BODY>
<!-- V0.9.16: reordered the following -->
<IFNDEF __NOXWPSETUP__>
<!-- V1.0.2: replaced "extended file types" with "turbo folders" -->
If turbo folders have been enabled in the
<A HREF="objects/obj_xwpsetup.html">"&xwp; Setup" object</A>,
&xwp; replaces the original "Types" page in data file properties
notebooks with an enhanced version.
</IFNDEF>

<P>This page displays all file types in a tree, as they were defined
on the "File types" page in the
&link_wpsobj;. As opposed
to that page, each file type on this page has a check box next to it
which determines whether the data file has that type currently set.

<P>See <A HREF="glossary/gls_assocs.html">Types and associations</A>
for an introduction to associations between data files and programs.

<UL><LI>If a box is <B>checked,</B> the respective type is currently
set for the data file. To remove the type from the file, click onto the
check box.

<P><LI>If a box is <B>unchecked,</B> the respective type is not
currently set for the data file. Click onto the check box to add the
type to the file.

<P><LI>If a box is <B>checked, but disabled,</B> this means that
the respective type has automatically been set for the data file
according to a type filter, as defined in the "Workplace Shell" object.
For example, if the "Plain text" type has the <CODE>*.txt</CODE> filter
associated with it and the data file's title has a trailing <CODE>.txt</CODE>
string, "Plain text" becomes an automatic file type for this file.
