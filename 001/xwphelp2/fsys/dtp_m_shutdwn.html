<!-- V0.9.7: totally rewritten -->
This setting determines the style of the "Shutdown" menu item(s) in the Desktop's
context menu.

<UL><LI>If you have "Add submenu" enabled, this will remove the "Default &os2; shutdown"
menu item from the submenu.

<P><LI>If "Add submenu" is not enabled, this will remove the "Shutdown" menu item from
the Desktop's main context menu. Note that in this case, you will not be able to
use &xwp;'s eXtended Shutdown feature from the Desktop's context menu.
You can still use &os2;'s default shutdown procedure by
selecting the respective buttons from the Launchpad or &warpcenter;.
