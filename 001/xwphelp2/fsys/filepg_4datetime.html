<BODY>
The <B>"Date/time"</B> group displays file date information. For each
file, &os2; maintains three different pieces of information:

<OL><LI>The <B>creation date</B> shows the date/time when the file
was created. After that, this date will never be changed (unless the
file is completely rewritten by an application).
<P>Note that the
<!-- V0.9.13: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_fs.html">FAT</A>
file system has no way of storing this information,
so this field has no meaning there.

<P><LI>The <B>last write</B> field shows the last time when the
file has been written to. This will be equal to or newer than the creation
date/time.

<P><LI>The <B>last access</B> field shows the last time when the file
was read from. This will be identical to or newer than the "last write"
field.
