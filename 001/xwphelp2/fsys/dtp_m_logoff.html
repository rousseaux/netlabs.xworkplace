<BODY>
Uncheck this box to remove the &os2; default "Logoff network now" menu entry from the
Desktop's context menu.

<P>This menu item is visible if you have client network support installed with your
&os2;. If you don't have client network support installed, this menu item is never
visible in the first place, so this setting has no effect then.
