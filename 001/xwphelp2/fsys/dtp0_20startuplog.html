        &xwp;: Write WPSTART.LOG File

<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.14 -->
<!-- V0.9.19: replace remaining XWorkplace with &xwp;, changed startup log file name -->
<BODY>
If "Write WPSTART.LOG file" is enabled, &xwp; will write a log of what
is happening during startup of the Workplace Shell into a file called
<CODE>WPSTART.LOG</CODE>, which is placed into the root directory of your
boot drive. The contents of that file are overwritten with each Desktop startup.

<P>Enabling this setting might be useful if you are having problems with
&xwp; during startup.
