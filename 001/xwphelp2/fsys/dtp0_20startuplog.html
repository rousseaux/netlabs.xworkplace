<BODY>
If "Write XWPSTART.LOG file" is enabled, XWorkplace will write a log of what
is happening during startup of the Workplace Shell into a file called
<CODE>XWPSTART.LOG</CODE>, which is placed into the root directory of your
boot drive. The contents of that file are overwritten with each Desktop startup.

<P>Enabling this setting might be useful if you are having problems with
XWorkplace during startup.
