Uncheck this box to remove the &os2; default "Sort" submenu from the Desktop's

<!-- V0.9.4: link added -->
<A HREF="objects/obj_wps.html">"Workplace Shell" object,</A>
this will remove this item from the Desktop's &popmenu; only.
On the other hand side, the setting in "Workplace Shell" has no effect on the Desktop.
