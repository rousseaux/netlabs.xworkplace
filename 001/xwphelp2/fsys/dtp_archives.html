        &xwp;: "Archives" Page Replacement
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.0 -->
<BODY>
<IFNDEF __NOXWPSETUP__>
&xwp; replaces the default "Archives" page with an enhanced version
if the respective setting has been enabled in the
<!-- V0.9.2: link added -->
<A HREF="objects/obj_xwpsetup.html">"&xwp; Setup" object</A>.
</IFNDEF>
On this page, you may set detailed criteria for whether your Desktop
should be backed up at Desktop startup.

<P>In order to restore an archive which has been created by the
Workplace Shell archiving mechanism, press Alt-F1 while the
<!-- V0.9.20 -->
small white "&os2short;" text box is displayed at system bootup.

<IFNDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
<P>Please see the <I>&xwp; User Guide</I> for an introduction to
this feature. Again, this enhanced page does not modify the archiving
mechanism itself; it only determines <I>whether</I> archiving is enabled,
according to the criteria you specify here.
</IFNDEF>

<!-- V0.9.16: moved this down
Note that all these checks are only performed while the WPS is starting
up. You will therefore have to restart the WPS to see any changes. -->

<P>The <B>"Archive Desktop"</B> setting determines whether &xwp; will
perform any archiving at all.

<P>If that setting is enabled, you may influence in detail <I>when</I>
your Desktop should be backed up.
<!-- V0.9.16: -->
Note that all these checks are only performed while the Desktop is starting
up. You will therefore have to restart the Desktop to see any changes:

<UL>
<IFNDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
<LI><B>"At every Desktop startup"</B> does exactly the same as the generic
backup setting on the old WPS "Archives" page. If this is enabled, the Desktop
will be backed up every time it starts up.
</IFNDEF>

<IFDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
<LI>If <B>"At every Desktop startup"</B> is checked, the Desktop
will be backed up every time it starts up. This is the same behavior as
with OS/2 Warp.
</IFDEF>

<P><LI><B>"At next Desktop startup only"</B> will back up the Desktop exactly once.
After the next Desktop startup, this setting will be disabled again automatically.

<P><LI><B>"If INI files have changed..."</B> will go over the
<CODE>OS2.INI</CODE> and <CODE>OS2SYS.INI</CODE>
files during Desktop startup and compute a number of checksums to find out how much the
contents of these files have changed. If that computation exceeds the percentage you
specify with this setting, your Desktop will be backed up automatically.
<P>Useful values for this are between 0.5 and 5 percent. If you specify very low
values, your Desktop might be backed up at every startup also.

<P><LI><B>"Every xxx days"</B> will simply check when the last archive was created;
if more than the number of days which you have specified have passed, your Desktop
will be backed up.
<P>Note that this only checks the pure calendar date, not the amount of time (e.g.
hours) which have passed. If you restart the Desktop one minute after midnight, your
Desktop may be backed up, even if it has been backed up just before midnight already.

</UL>The <B>"Show status at bootup"</B> setting determines whether &xwp; displays
another status window while the Desktop is starting up, which displays the results of
the aforementioned computations. This might be useful for testing your settings.

<P><B>"Keep xxx archives"</B> lets you specify how many archives are kept by the
Desktop in the archives directory tree. This defaults to 3, but you may keep up to
9 archives, theoretically. However, if this number exceeds 3, the standard screen
which comes up when you press Alt-F1 during system startup will be partly unreadable,
because the additional archives information will make the top scroll off the screen.
This doesn't hurt, it just looks ugly.

<!-- This is new with 1.0.4 -->
<!-- Modified with 1.0.5 -->

<P>If <B>Display at each system startup</B> is selected, the system
automatically displays the Recovery Choices screen each time it starts,
and you do not have to press Alt-F1 during boot to display it.

<P>Use <B>Timeout</B> to specify how long the system is to
display the Recovery Choices screen during startup. You cannot specify a
value if "Display at each system startup" is deselected.

<P>You can specify a time limit from 0 to 999 seconds.  If you select 0,
the system will not start until you enter a choice on the Recovery
Choices screen.
If you select a timeout value between 1 and 999, the system displays the
Recovery Choices screen until the number of seconds you specified has
elapsed or until you enter your recovery option, whichever comes first.
If the time limit elapses before you enter a recovery option, the system
continues to start using the current system files.
