<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.0 -->
<BODY>
Uncheck this box to remove the &os2; default "Arrange" item from the Desktop's
context menu.
<!-- V0.9.16 added ifdef -->
<IFNDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
On &warp4; and above, this will remove the entire "Arrange" submenu.
</IFNDEF>
<P>Note that as opposed to the corresponding setting in the
<!-- V0.9.4: link added -->
<A HREF="objects/obj_wps.html">"Workplace Shell" object,</A>
this will remove this item from the Desktop's context menu only.
On the other hand side, the setting in "Workplace Shell" has no effect on the Desktop.
<!-- V0.9.16 added ifdef -->
<IFNDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
This feature has been added with V0.9.0 because several people asked for it to
protect themselves from messing up the Desktop accidentally.
