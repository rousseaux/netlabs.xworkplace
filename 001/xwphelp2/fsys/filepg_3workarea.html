only and determines whether the folder
is a "work area folder".

<P>Work-area folders have two special features.  When
you close the folder, all windows belonging to the
objects within the folder are closed automatically
and the view of each object is saved.  When you
open the folder the next time, the windows for the
objects in the folder are displayed with their
previous view.

<P>The other feature is that when you
hide the window of a work-area folder, all windows
belonging to the objects in the folder are hidden
automatically.  When you show the work-area folder
(from the Window List), the windows for the objects
in the folder are displayed with their previous view.

<P>If you minimize a work-area folder, only the icon for
the work-area folder is displayed in the Minimized
Window Viewer or on the Desktop.  The windows
belonging to the objects in the work-area folder are
not displayed.

<P>Work-area folders function with the icon or details
view, but not with the tree view.

<P>This item cannot be disabled for the Desktop.
