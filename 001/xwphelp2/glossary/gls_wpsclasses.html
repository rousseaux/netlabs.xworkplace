&os2;'s Workplace Shell (WPS) is frequently described as
<B>"object-oriented".</B> This term suggests that -- as opposed to other user
operating system's user interfaces -- everything the Workplace Shell
deals with is first considered an <B>"object":</B> this applies, for example,
to files, folders, printers, drives etc. All these objects have certain common
characteristics (such as context menus and properties notebooks), but differ in
certain others: for example, what you see in a context menu depends
on the selected object.

<P>In order to better handle these common and different
characteristics, the WPS uses <B>"classes".</B> This term has been taken from
object-oriented programming; a class is, so-to-say, an abstract concept, or
a template, for an object.
A class is therefore not visible on the Desktop, it thus does not
"exist" in the same sense as objects do, but it contains all the information
about properties and capabilities of an object and the executable code
to make an object do something.

<P>All WPS classes reside in <B>dynamic link libraries</B> (DLLs). For
example, most of the default WPS classes reside in the large <CODE>PMWP.DLL</CODE>
file in the <CODE>\OS2\DLL</CODE> directory. All &xwp; classes reside in
<CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE> in the &xwp; installation directory.

<P>Now, every object on the Desktop is a so-called <B>"instance"</B> of some
class. The names of most of the WPS classes start with "WP": for example, a
printer is  an instance of the "WPPrinter" class, a folder one of the class
"WPFolder", a datafile of "WPDataFile" and so on.

<P>The reason for the power and flexibility of the class concept is that the
different classes may <B>descend</B> from each other. Such a descendant
class will <B>inherit</B> all of the properties and capabilities from its
parent class. It is thus possible to make certain features of the
user-interface more abstract, according to the old principle:
the best way to handle complexity is abstraction.

<P>The WPS contains many classes, which make up a very thoughtful
inheritance hierarchy. The following excerpt from the WPS class list may
make the general structure more lucid (where the lines represent parentship):

<PRE>
 WPObject
   ÃÄÄ WPAbstract
   ³     ÃÄÄ WPPrinter
   ³     ÃÄÄ WPProgram
   ³     ÀÄÄ WPShadow
   ÃÄÄ WPFileSystem
   ³     ÃÄÄ WPDataFile
   ³     ³      ÃÄÄ WPIcon
   ³     ³      ÀÄÄ WPProgramFile
   ³     ÀÄÄ WPFolder
   ³            ÃÄÄ WPDesktop
   ³            ÀÄÄ WPStartup
   ÀÄÄ WPTransient
</PRE>

<P>You see that all classes are descendants of <CODE>WPObject</CODE>,
which is therefore called the "root class" of all WPS classes.
This implements all the features that are
common to all Desktop objects: as mentioned before, e.g. context menus and
properties notebooks. However, the WPObject class is too abstract to have
instances of it: this class was only implemented to have other descendant
classes. Objects of this class will not function.

<P>WPObject has only three descendant classes. All these classes are -- like
WPObject -- only meant to be abstract parent classes, of which no objects
should exist directly.

<OL><LI><CODE>WPAbstract</CODE> is the common parent class for so-called "abstract"
objects, i.e. those objects which do not physically exist on disk, but only
store their data in <CODE>OS2.INI</CODE>. The most well-known
examples for this are the classes <CODE>WPPrinter</CODE> for printer
objects, <CODE>WPProgram</CODE> for program objects, and <CODE>WPShadow</CODE>
for shadows. All these objects can appear in folders, but are not visible if
you enter <CODE>DIR</CODE> at the command line, for example.

<P><LI>By contrast, <CODE>WPFileSystem</CODE> is the common superclass for
objects which do exist physically in a file system of a drive. There are two subtypes:
folders (<CODE>WPFolder</CODE> class) and data files (<CODE>WPDataFile</CODE>).
In turn, there are
several subclasses of WPDataFile, like <CODE>WPIcon</CODE> for icon files
and <CODE>WPProgramFile</CODE> for program files (executables, usually with
the <CODE>.EXE</CODE> extension).
All data files for which no more specific subclass exists are instances of
<CODE>WPDataFile</CODE>.

<P><LI>Finally, <CODE>WPTransient</CODE> is used by the WPS for objects which
need not save their data at all, but only exist temporarily for representing
something. Examples of this are print jobs in a printer object and all the
devices in Warp 4's Hardware Manager.

</OL>The WPS also offers an exceptional mechanism called <B>class replacements.</B>
This feature is used extensively by &xwp; to hook all of its features
into the WPS by replacing a number of standard WPS classes. For example, the
<CODE>XFolder</CODE> class itself replaces the <CODE>WPFolder</CODE> class
to implement all the new folder features.

<P>Such a replacement class must always be a descendant of
the class which it should replace; "replacing" the class then means that the
WPS will always use the replacement class whenever the original class
would normally be used. As a result, if &xwp; is installed, all
folders of your system are no longer instances of <CODE>WPFolder</CODE>,
but of <CODE>XFolder</CODE>.
But since <CODE>XFolder</CODE> is a descendant of <CODE>WPFolder</CODE>,
all standard folder characteristics are inherited and still exist with the folders
on your system.

<P>Using class replacements enables programmers to implement new features for a
class without having to know in detail how a certain class works internally.
This is an outstanding and powerful concept, which is unmatched by other
operating systems.

<IFNDEF __NOWPSCLASSLIST__>
<P>If you open &xwp;'s
<A HREF="clst_main.html">"WPS Class List"</A> object, all of
the classes installed on your system will be
displayed. Regularily, these will be more than 100 classes, which will appear
in a tree structure. Using context menus, you may register and replace
classes here and also deregister classes and undo class replacements. Also,
you can attempt to create an object (that is: an instance) of many classes
on your Desktop.

<P>Please note that you should be very careful when manipulating the WPS
class list. By making the wrong change, you can make your system unusable!
