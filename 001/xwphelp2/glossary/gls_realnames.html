<BODY>
While, per definition, every WPS object has a title associated with it,
only file-system objects (that is, files or folders which physically
reside in a file system) also carry a so-called "real name".
<!-- V0.9.19 : added this -->
This is the name of the file that the file-system object represents
on disk, as visible with the <CODE>DIR</CODE> command on an &os2;
command line.

<P>In many cases, the real name is identical to the object title
(as displayed on the "Icon" page); however, file-system names have
certain limitations.

<P>For object <I>titles,</I> the only restriction is that they cannot
be longer than 256 characters, and that the backslash (<CODE>\</CODE>)
character is forbidden.

<P>By contrast, depending on the object's <A HREF="glossary/gls_fs.html">file system</A>,
the following restrictions apply to the object's <I>real name</I>:

<UL><LI>With the FAT file system, file names are restricted to 8 characters,
plus a 3-character file extension. In addition, the following characters
are not allowed in FAT file names:

<P><CODE>&lt; &gt; | + = : ; , " / [ ]</CODE>

<P>In addition, the FAT file system is not case-preserving.

<P><LI>With installable file systems (IFS's) such as HPFS or JFS, the
file name can be up to 254 characters in length, and there are no rules
about file-name extensions. However, the following characters are still
invalid:

<P><CODE>&lt; &gt; | : " / </CODE>

</UL>Naturally, the backslash character (<CODE>\</CODE>) is invalid
with every file system because it is used as the path separator in &os2;.

<P>If the title of the file-system object obeys these restrictions, the
real name is identical to the title.
However, <I>if not,</I> the WPS modifies the
title to match these restrictions by truncating it to the allowed file-name
length and replacing illegal characters with exclamation marks (<CODE>!</CODE>).
The original title is then stored with the object in the <CODE>.LONGNAME</CODE>
extended attribute.

<P>In that case, the "real name" that is displayed with the
<CODE>DIR</CODE> command from the &os2; command line is different from the
title displayed in the WPS folder.

<P>Examples:

<OL><LI>The folder title is <CITE>LongFolderTitle</CITE>,
but the folder resides on a FAT drive, so the path on the folder's "File"
page will display <CITE>C:\LONGFOLD</CITE> only.

<P><LI>The folder title is <CITE>Accounting/Taxes</CITE>, but the real name
is  <CITE>Accounting!Taxes</CITE> (assuming the folder is on an HPFS or JFS
drive).
</OL>
