With &os2;, the following terminology is used when dealing with
storage devices:

<OL><LI>A <B>drive</B> is a logical entity that has been assigned a drive
letter by the &os2; kernel. You can therefore have up to 26 drives, which
are named from <CODE>A:</CODE> to <CODE>Z:</CODE>.

<P>The &link_drivesfdr; shows all drives that currently exist on your system.
Drives <CODE>A:</CODE> and <CODE>B:</CODE> will always be
diskette drives per definition. Other drive letters will either be
hard disk volumes (see below), CD-ROM or DVD drives, network resources
that have been assigned a drive letter, or other storage hardware.

<P><LI>A <B>volume</B> is a concept specific to hard disks
and consists of one or more partitions (see below). A volume must be
formatted with a specific <A HREF="glossary/gls_fs.html">file system</A>
in order to be able to hold data.

<P><LI>A <B>partition</B> is a physical segment of a hard disk. In order
to be used with personal computers, each hard disk must at least have
one partition, but can be divided into several, for example if you want
to use more than one operating system or several file systems.

</OL>&os2;'s <B>Logical Volume Manager (LVM)</B> allows you to create, delete,
and edit volumes and partitions. Use LVM also to assign a drive letter
to a volume and thus make it a drive or to hide a volume from &os2;.

<P>There are several options to start LVM:

<UL><LI>From the &link_drivesfdr;, select "Manage volumes" in the
<A HREF="glossary/gls_popmenu.html">&popmenu;</A>.

<P><LI>In the &link_syssetupfdr;, start the "Logical Volume Manger" object.

<P><LI>Open a <A HREF="glossary/gls_cmd.html">command prompt</A> and
type <CODE>LVM</CODE>. As opposed to the previous two options, this will
start the text-mode version of LVM.
