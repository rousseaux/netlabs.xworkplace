Under &os2;, programs run in <B>sessions.</B>
A session consists of one or more <A HREF="glossary/gls_scheduler.html">processes</A>
and can run in a window or in full-screen mode. In addition,
every session has a special type, depending on
the operating system that a program was written for.

<P>Even though programs are normally written to run under a specific
operating system, &os2; has built-in support to be able to execute
programs for other operating systems too.
&os2; supports the following <B>session types:</B>

<UL><LI>The <B>Presentation Manager (PM)</B> session. PM is the graphics
subsystem of &os2; and is responsible for managing multiple windows
on the screen, supporting graphics output such as icons and pictures,
mouse and keyboard input, and standard controls such as menus and title bars.
For example, the help window which displays the text you are currently
reading is a PM window. The &os2; Workplace Shell, which displays
your Desktop, is a PM program too.

<P>PM programs always run in the one and only PM session that is started
when the system starts up. You cannot start a second PM session. However,
you can extend your screen space with the use of the
<A HREF="hook/pager_intro.html">&pgr;</A>, which allows you to switch
between several virtual desktops.

<P><LI>Many OS/2 programs however do not use PM, but run in text mode
instead. Any <B>OS/2 text-mode</B> program, including
<A HREF="objects/obj_pgmf_batch.html">command files</A>
(<CODE>.CMD</CODE> extension), will be started in a separate
session that can either be a windowed or full-screen.

<BR><P><B>Windowed command prompts</B> <IMG SRC="img/os2_os2win.gif"> are visible on
your Desktop as well as if they were part of the PM session, so you can
still see all other windows that are open.

<BR>By contrast, an <B>full-screen session</B> <IMG SRC="img/os2_os2full.gif">
will occupy the entire screen. Your other windows are still open and the
other programs keep running, but in order to see them, you have to switch
back to the PM session using the <CODE>Alt+Esc</CODE> or <CODE>Ctrl+Esc</CODE>
system hotkeys.

<P><LI>&os2; can also run the large majority of <B>DOS programs</B>.
DOS is the original operating system for personal computers that was
shipped with the first IBM PC. DOS programs, including
<A HREF="objects/obj_pgmf_batch.html">batch files</A>
(<CODE>.BAT</CODE> extension),
usually run in text-mode and can run windowed or full-screen as well.

<BR><B>Windowed DOS sessions</B> <IMG SRC="img/os2_doswin.gif"> are visible on
your Desktop as well.

<BR><B>Full-screen DOS sessions</B> <IMG SRC="img/os2_dosfull.gif">
will occupy the entire screen, similarly to other full-screen sessions.

<P><LI>&os2; can also natively execute the great majority of
16-bit Windows applications written for Microsoft Windows 3.x.

<BR>These run in so-called <B>&winos2; sessions</B>
<IMG SRC="img/os2_win16.gif"> which can be windowed or full-screen
as well. If a &winos2; program is started as a window, it runs seamlessly
on the &os2; Desktop as if it was a PM program, even it will have
a slightly different appearance. However, you can also select to
run a &winos2; program in a separate full-screen session.
