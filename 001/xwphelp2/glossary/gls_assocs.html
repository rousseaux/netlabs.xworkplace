In the Workplace Shell, associations link data files to
program objects and program files.

<IFNDEF __NOXWPSETUP__>
If extended file types have been enabled in the
<A HREF="objects/obj_xwpsetup.html">"&xwp; Setup" object</A>,
this is done entirely with the use of file types.
</IFNDEF>

<P>The <B>type</B> of a data file depends on two sources:

<UL><LI>You can explicitly set a type on the "Types" page
of a data file's <A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>.
This type is stored in
the extended attributes of the file and remain there unless
you remove it again.

<P><LI>In addition, &xwp; also associates file types
automatically according to so-called "filters", which are
strings containing the standard
<A HREF="glossary/gls_wildcards.html">wildcards</A>
"*" and/or "?".

<P>These file type filters can be defined on the "File types" page in the
<A HREF="objects/obj_wps.html">"Workplace Shell" object</A>. For example,
you can create a file type "Acrobat PDF" with the filter <CODE>*.PDF</CODE>,
and all such files will automatically receive that type.

</UL>If a program object has been <B>associated</B> with a file
type, the program object appears in the "Open" context menu
of all data files which have that type. The first association
determines the icon of the data file and is also used when
you double-click on the file.

<P>In the above example, if you now associate the "Acrobat PDF" type
with the program object for the Adobe Acrobat Reader, all files
matching <CODE>*.PDF</CODE> can be opened with that program object.

<P>In addition, file types may <B>inherit</B> from each other. You
can define those parent-child relationships on the "File types" page in the
<A HREF="objects/obj_wps.html">"Workplace Shell" object</A>, simply by dragging
the file types around. If a type has thus been made a child of another type,
the associations for the parent type will also be available for all data files
of the child type.

<P>For example, assume that you also have defined a "PostScript" file type.
Since PDF documents are really special PostScript files, you can make
"Acrobat PDF" a child type of "PostScript". If you have, say, a GhostScript
association for the "PostScript" type, your PDF files can then also be
opened with the GhostScript program.
