<BODY>
Command operators are special characters that the command processors
interpret as specific commands rather than regular input characters.
These operators can be typed at a command prompt or be included in a
batch or command file.

<P>If you intend to use a character that is normally interpreted as
a command operator as a regular character, you must <B>escape</B> it
by preceding it with the <CODE>^</CODE> character.
Some command operators are valid at the OS/2 command prompt only, not
in DOS sessions.

<P>The following lists the command operators in the order in which the
command processors recognize them:

<UL><LI>The <CODE>^</CODE> character escapes a command operator to be
recognized as regular input or output characters
(OS/2 sessions only).

For example, to display the following output on the screen:
<PRE>TYPE YOUR AGE &amp; SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER ==&gt;</PRE>
type:
<PRE>ECHO TYPE YOUR AGE ^&amp; SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER ==^&gt;</PRE>

<LI>Parentheses <CODE>()</CODE> group commands so that they override
the regular order of precedence recognized by the command processor
(OS/2 sessions only).

<P><LI><CODE>&gt;</CODE> redirects output to a file or device. If the file
exists, it is overwritten.

<P><CODE>&gt;&gt;</CODE> redirects output to a file and appends to
it, if it exists.

<P><CODE>&lt;</CODE> retrieves and redirects input from the standard
input device.

<P>The input source and the output targets of a program are predefined
and identified by a number (called a <B>handle</B>). The following three
exist:

<UL><LI>Standard input is called <CODE>STDIN</CODE>, whose handle is 0.
By default, this is the keyboard.
<LI>Standard output is called <CODE>STDOUT</CODE>, whose handle is 1.
By default, this is the screen.
<LI>For error messages, a different output is used (<CODE>STDERR</CODE>),
whose handle is 2. By default this is the screen also, but this allows
for redirecting error messages separately.

</UL>You can redirect input and output for a program only if the program
is reading from <CODE>STDIN</CODE> and writing to <CODE>STDOUT</CODE>,
including <CODE>STDERR</CODE>. If the
program does not implement these standard conventions, for example if
it is not a text-mode program or directly reads from and writes to the
hardware, redirection does not work.

<P>If more than one operation is specified, only the last
one is recognized.

<P><B>Example 1:</B> To redirect the output of the
<A HREF="cmdref.inf#DIR"><CODE>DIR</CODE></A> command to the printer,
type:
<PRE>DIR &gt; PRN</PRE>

<B>Example 2:</B> To redirect the output of the <CODE>DIR</CODE> command
to a new file called <CODE>listing.txt</CODE>, type:
<PRE>DIR &gt; listing.txt</PRE>
The file <CODE>listing.txt</CODE> will be created automatically or
overwritten, if it exists already.

<P><B>Example 3:</B> To redirect both <CODE>STDERR</CODE> and
<CODE>STDOUT</CODE>, you redirect <CODE>STDOUT</CODE> first and
then redirect <CODE>STDERR</CODE> to <CODE>STDOUT</CODE>. Redirection handles
used in place of file names must be preceded by an <CODE>&amp;</CODE>
character. So to send all output and error listings from the <CODE>DIR</CODE>
command to a new file named <CODE>listing.txt</CODE>, type:
<PRE>DIR *.* &gt;listing.txt 2&gt;&amp;1</PRE>

<LI>The solid vertical bar (<CODE>|</CODE>), ASCII character 124,
is used for separating two commands for <B>piping.</B> A pipe intercepts
the output of one running program and sends it as input to another running program.

<P>Pipes are most frequently used with <B>filters.</B> Filters are system
utilities that intercept data from <CODE>STDIN</CODE>,
process it, and send it to <CODE>STDOUT</CODE>.

<P>&os2; provides three filters:
<A HREF="cmdref.inf#SORT"><CODE>SORT</CODE></A>,
<A HREF="cmdref.inf#FIND"><CODE>FIND</CODE></A>, and
<A HREF="cmdref.inf#MORE"><CODE>MORE</CODE></A>. Many additional filters
are available from third parties.

<P><B>Example:</B> To display the current directory list sorted and send the output
to a file named <code>sorted.txt</code>, type:
<PRE>DIR | SORT &gt; sorted.txt</PRE>

<B>Note:</B> When there is an invalid command
on the left side of the pipe, the command on the right side of the pipe
will not take effect.  For example:
<PRE>xxxx 2&gt;&amp;1 | MORE
</PRE>will not pipe the error output to <CODE>MORE</CODE> because <CODE>xxxx</CODE>
is an invalid program.

<P><LI><CODE>&amp;&amp;</CODE> conditionally processes a sequence of
commands.  A command in the sequence can be processed only if the preceding
command runs successfully
(OS/2 sessions only).

<P><LI><CODE>||</CODE> conditionally processes a sequence of commands.
A command in the sequence can be processed only if the preceding command
fails to run successfully
(OS/2 sessions only).

<P><LI><CODE>&amp;</CODE> unconditionally processes individual commands in
a sequence, regardless of the success or failure of preceding commands in
the sequence
(OS/2 sessions only).
