File-system caches are a mechanism used by most of today's operating
systems to avoid redundant disk accesses. In order to accomplish this, a part of
the computer's physical memory (RAM) is used to buffer data that is read
from and written to disk. This memory region is then called a "cache".

<P>See <A HREF="glossary/gls_fs.html">"File systems"</A> for introductory information about file systems.

<P>Do not confuse the file-system caches with the other caches that exist
on your system, such as the processor caches
and maybe other hardware caches that are built into your hard disks.
The concept of these caches is the same (avoid slow accesses by using
fast memory if possible), but they are not described here.

<P>If an application accesses disk data that is still residing in the
file-system cache, &os2; does not have to read it from the
disk, but can simply take it from the cache in memory, which is a lot faster.

<P>On the other hand side, if an application is writing data to disk, &os2; can
copy this data to the cache first and delay writing it to disk until the disk is
ready for accepting it, or the system is idle. This is called <B>"lazy writing"</B>
and can greatly improve your system's performance.
On the other hand size, this increases the danger of data loss
in case of power shortages or fatal system crashes, because data in the caches
gets lost then. You should still have lazy writing enabled if you have a
reasonably stable &os2; system and rarely get CHKDSK's at bootup.

<P>&os2; implements separate caches for each file system that is installed. This
means that all FAT
<!-- V0.9.20: replace drives with volumes -->
volumes will use one cache, and all HPFS
<!-- V0.9.20: replace drives with volumes -->
volumes a different
one. These caches are separately configured with different &cfgsys;
settings.
<!-- V0.9.20: added link, added ifndef -->
<IFNDEF __NOOS2KERNEL__>
You can edit these settings in the <A HREF="objects/obj_krnl.html">"&os2; Kernel"</A>
object. You will find the
HPFS settings on the "Drivers" page in that object, since HPFS is an
installable file system (IFS). By contrast, since FAT is built into the &os2;
Kernel itself, it has its own page.
</IFNDEF>

<P>Please keep in mind that memory you reserve for file-system caches is no longer
available for other purposes. If you reserve too much cache memory, this will
have a negative impact on your system performance, because &os2; will spend more time
on your swap file. As a result, you should reflect a bit on what settings you specify
here.

<P>In general, the more memory you have on your system, the more memory you should
reserve for the caches. You should also take in account which file systems you use
more frequently: for example, if you mainly use HPFS
<!-- V0.9.20: replace drives with volumes -->
volumes, it's a waste to reserve
much memory for FAT caches, and vice versa.

<P>This is not so much an issue any more considering the amount of memory which
is installed in today's computers. However, if you still only have 16 MB RAM or
less, you shouldn't reserve more than 1024 KB cache for both file systems altogether.
