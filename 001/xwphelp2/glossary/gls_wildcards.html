<BODY>
Wildcards are a common mechanism with all operating systems that allow
for matching several file names with one character string. Wildcards
are most frequently used on the DOS or &os2; command line, but are
also used in the Workplace Shell.

<P>&os2; understands two wildcard characters:

<OL><LI>The <B>asterisk</B> (<CODE>*</CODE>) character matches any sequence
of characters (no character, one character, or many characters).

<P>For example, <CODE>h*e</CODE> will match <CODE>he</CODE>,
<CODE>house</CODE>, and <CODE>home</CODE>.

<P><LI>The <B>question mark</B> (<CODE>?</CODE>) matches exactly one character.

<P>For example, <CODE>h??e</CODE> will match <CODE>home</CODE>, but
not <CODE>he</CODE> or <CODE>house</CODE>.

</OL>Wildcards can also be combined. For example, <CODE>h*e.?xt</CODE>
will match <CODE>house.txt</CODE>.

<P>Note that as opposed to DOS, the dot (<CODE>.</CODE>) in file names
is not a special character, unless you are working with files on the
<A HREF="glossary/gls_fs.html">FAT</A>
file system.
