<BODY>
In general, a thread with a higher priority gets more processor time that one
with lower priority. To be more precise, &os2; looks at thread priorities
if more than one thread is internally marked as "ready".

<P>By contrast, threads which are currently
"blocked" need no CPU time anyway, so for them, priorities do not matter
until they are unblocked again. Note that on your typical &os2; system,
the large majority of threads will be in "blocked" state at any given
point in time.

<P>&os2; is capable of controlling thread priorities in a very refined way.
It differentiates between four <B>priority classes:</B>

<!-- V0.9.19: corrected all the following -->

<OL><LI><B>"Idle time priority"</B> (1) is the lowest priority class. This means that a
thread only gets processor time if no threads of higher priority classes
are running. Such threads are helpful for offloading work that needs to be
done, but can be delayed until the computer has time for it.

<!-- V1.0.0 (2002-09-13) [umoeller]: removed this section
An example of such a thread is &xwp;'s own
<A HREF="glossary/gls_workerthr.html">Worker thread</A>, which keeps track of
the awake Desktop objects on your system. This is fairly time-consuming,
but not time-critical, so it's done with idle-time priority.
-->

<P><LI><B>"Regular priority"</B> (2) is the priority class that most threads use. It is
also the default &os2; priority class if a thread does not explicitly change its
priority. Between threads of this class, &os2; dynamically varies priority levels
(more on this below) to make sure that no thread of this class "starves", i.e. gets
no processor time.

<P><LI><B>"Foreground server priority"</B> (4) is the second-highest priority class
for threads that do not want to be influenced by the dynamic priority variations
that are performed on "regular" class threads. Note that even though this class
has the value 4, time-critical threads do take priority over threads of this class.
&os2; still does some priority variations on threads of this class based on the
activity of the thread and the system.

<P><LI><B>"Time-critical priority"</B> (3) is the highest priority class in &os2;.
A thread with time-critical priority will be given processor time immediately
and will not be interrupted until its work is done.
Many device drivers will yield the CPU only to threads of this priority class.

<P>Such a thread should only use the minimum possible CPU time because it cannot be
interrupted (except by other time-critical threads) and can easily hang the system.
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
Even if it yields the CPU via <CODE>DosSleep(0)</CODE>
(see the documentation for
<A HREF="cpref.inf#DosSleep"><CODE>DosSleep</CODE></A>
in the Toolkit documentation<A HREF="_toolkitlink.html">*</A>),
other non-time-critical threads will not run.
<!-- V1.0.0: changed the following phrase -->
This class is therefore normally only used for network and other communications software,
or CD writer or other multimedia software.

<!-- end V0.9.19 -->

</OL>Within each priority class, a thread may set a <B>priority level.</B>
This is a value from 0 to +31 which determines the precedence of a thread
<I>within</I> a priority class and will only be taken into account if two threads
of the same priority class compete.

<P>A few examples:

<UL><LI>A "regular" thread with priority level +31 supercedes a "regular" thread
with priority level 0.

<P>Within the "regular priority" class however &os2; ensures that no thread
"starves", i.e. never gets processor time, by dynamically raising each
thread's priorities after a certain time automatically. This period of time
is determined by the <CODE>MAXWAIT</CODE> &cfgsys; setting. Moreover, &os2;
boosts a thread's priority temporarily if it is to receive keyboard input,
if the process of the thread runs in the foreground, or if the thread is
currently doing I/O.

<P>These dynamic adjustments are only then performed if &cfgsys; does
not contain the command <CODE>PRIORITY=ABSOLUTE,</CODE> which is not
recommended.
<!-- V0.9.19: added ifdef -->
<IFNDEF __NOOS2KERNEL__>
(This is why you will not find that setting in the
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="objects/obj_krnl.html">"&os2; Kernel"</A> object.)
</IFNDEF>

<P><LI>A "time-critical" thread with priority level 0 still supercedes a
"regular" thread with priority level +31 because it belongs to a higher
priority class. For this case, the dynamic priority adjustments will have
no effect, because they only affect the execution of "regular" threads.
While the time-critical thread is running, all "regular" threads starve.

<P><LI>The same applies, for example, to a "regular thread" with priority level
0 and an "idle-time" thread with priority level +31.

<P><LI>Two threads with exactly the same priority however run "against" each
other, i.e. &os2; keeps alternating CPU ownership between them.
