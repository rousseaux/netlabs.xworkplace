        The &xwp; PM Hook

<!-- this is all new with V0.9.13 -->
<BODY>
The &xwp; PM hook is a routine in <CODE>XWPDAEMN.EXE</CODE> which can, if
enabled, monitor and manipulate Presentation Manager (PM) messages.

<P>This allows &xwp; to manipulate the behavior of all windows and
keyboard and mouse events on your system. This is how object hotkeys,
sliding focus, sliding menus, screen border objects, PageMage etc. work.
If a certain event is detected by the hook, &xwp; can take a special
action, such as opening an object or making another window active.

<P>As a consequence, the &xwp; PM hook must be enabled first for all
those features to work.

<P>The problem with PM hooks is that they are global. Since several applications
can install such hooks, they might conflict. Well-known OS/2 tools that
install hooks also are NPS WPS, WarpEnhancer, DragText, and others. This is
why &xwp; allows you disable its PM hook altogether, in case it is
conflicting with some other application.
