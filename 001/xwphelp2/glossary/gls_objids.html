The Workplace Shell allows each object to have an optional object ID,
which uniquely identifies the object on the system. All objects can
have such IDs, no matter of which <A HREF="glossary/gls_wpsclasses.html">WPS class</A>.

<P>Per definition, Desktop object IDs must be a character string in angle
brackets. For example, the standard "System setup" folder has the
<CODE>&lt;WP_CONFIG&gt;</CODE> object ID.
Using an object ID, applications can reference objects without having to
know in which folder they actually reside.

<P>Many object IDs are assigned by the OS/2 installation program when
the system is first installed and usually never changed afterwards.
(Those IDs should not be changed in the first place because certain
applications or the WPS itself might rely on the ID to identify the
object.)

<P>However, there are usually many more object IDs on your system than
those assigned by the initial OS/2 install. Many installation programs
will also assign IDs to their objects in order to be able to remove
them again later.

<P>&xwp; allows you to view and change an object's ID on the
<!-- V0.9.16: change "Object" to "Icon" -->
"Icon"
page in each object's properties notebook. However, great care should
be taken when changing object IDs.
