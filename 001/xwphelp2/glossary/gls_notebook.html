<BODY>
In the Workplace Shell, almost every object has a properties notebook
associated with it where you can look at and possibly change the object's
characteristics.

<P>To open the properties notebook for an object, first click on the object
with mouse button 2 to open its context menu. Then select the "Properties"
menu item.

<P>For folders, you can also open the context menu by clicking with mouse
button 2 on an empty area of an open folder window, where you will find
the "Properties" menu item as well.

<P>A window will open which usually has several pages on it, depending on
the object's <A HREF="glossary/gls_wpsclasses.html">class</A>. Each page in turn has
a "Help" button where you can find out more about what the page does.
