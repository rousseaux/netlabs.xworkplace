<BODY>
Every file-system object (file or folder) has a <B>path</B>
associated with it, which indicates to the system where
the object is stored so that it can be referenced from
applications.

<P>The path consists of all the directories that must be opened
to get to a particular file. (Directories are the
physical representations of &link_folders;
on disk.)

<P>A fully qualified path consists of the drive name, followed
by a colon (<CODE>:</CODE>), an initial backslash (<CODE>\</CODE>)
to indicate the root directory, plus a list of directories that
must be opened to get to the object, each separated by another
backslash.

<P>If the path points to a file, for example a
<A HREF="objects/obj_dataf.html">data file</A> or
<A HREF="objects/obj_pgmf.html">program file</A>,
it is followed by the file name. For example, the &os2; &eexe; resides
in the <CODE>OS2</CODE> directory on the boot drive. Its full path is:

<PRE>
    X:\OS2\E.EXE
</PRE>

where <CODE>X:</CODE> is the drive letter of your boot drive.

<P>&os2; has several <B>system paths</B> which specify where the system
should look for files if a path is not supplied with a file.
See <A HREF="glossary/gls_path_sys.html">"System paths"</A> for more explanations.
