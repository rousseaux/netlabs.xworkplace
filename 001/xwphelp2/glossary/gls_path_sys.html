        &xwp;: System Paths
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<!-- all new with V0.9.20 -->
<BODY>
&os2; has several <B>system paths</B> which specify where the system
should look for files if a
<A HREF="glossary/gls_path.html">path</A> is not supplied with a file.

<P>For example, if an executable file is in the list of directories
specified by the <CODE>PATH</CODE> system path, the executable can be
found without knowing where exactly it is stored on the system. This
is why you can simply type <CODE>e</CODE> on an &os2; command prompt
to start the &os2; &eexe;: <CODE>E.EXE</CODE> resides in the <CODE>OS2</CODE>
directory on your boot drive, which is on the <CODE>PATH</CODE>.

<P>Except for <CODE>LIBPATH</CODE>, these are
<A HREF="glossary/gls_env.html">environment variables</A>
that are initially set during system startup through the &cfgsys;
file and can thus be modified later for every session.

<IFNDEF __NOOS2KERNEL__>
<P>You can edit the current system path settings on the "System paths"
page in the <A HREF="objects/obj_krnl.html">"&os2; Kernel"</A> object.
</IFNDEF>

<P>The following system paths are defined:

<!-- V0.9.20: the following has roughly been taken from kernel\krn_paths.html -->

<UL><LI><CODE>LIBPATH</CODE>: the "library" system path, which is searched every time
&os2; attempts to load a
<A HREF="glossary/gls_dll.html">dynamic link library (DLL).</A>
This better contain the &os2; system
directories as well as a dot (".") entry, which stands for the current directory.

<P>See the <A HREF="cmdref.inf#libpath">documentation</A> in the
<I>&os2; Command Reference</I> for details.

<P>Note that this is the only system path which is <I>not</I> defined using an environment
variable and can therefore not be changed from the command line. Use the <CODE>BEGINLIBPATH</CODE>
and <CODE>ENDLIBPATH</CODE> variables for temporary changes.

<P><LI><CODE>SET PATH</CODE>: the search path for executables (.EXE, .COM, .BAT, .CMD files).

<P>See the <A HREF="cmdref.inf#path">documentation</A> in the
<I>&os2; Command Reference</I> for details.

<P><LI><CODE>SET DPATH</CODE>: the search path for data files. The use of this search
path is dependent on the applications; some applications use this, others don't.

<P>See the <A HREF="cmdref.inf#dpath">documentation</A> in the
<I>&os2; Command Reference</I> for details.

<P><LI><CODE>SET BOOKSHELF</CODE>: this is evaluated by <CODE>VIEW.EXE</CODE> to find
online .INF books. Even though any INF book can be displayed, even if it's not on this
search path, the "Find" facility of <CODE>VIEW.EXE</CODE> will only find items in books
which reside on this path.

<!-- cmdref.inf#bookshelf doesn't work -->

<P><LI><CODE>SET HELP</CODE>: this is evaluated by the PM help facility to display
help panels (.HLP files). Some applications do not specify the full path of help files
to PM in order to display help panels, which requires the help file to reside on this
path. &xwp; does not require such an entry though.

<!-- cmdref.inf#help doesn't work -->
