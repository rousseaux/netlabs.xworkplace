        The &xwp; Worker thread
    </TITLE>

<!-- this is all new with V0.9.9 -->
<BODY>
The &xwp; "Worker" thread does all kinds of background
work which takes too long to be running on the main GUI thread of the WPS. These
tasks are offloaded to the Worker thread in order not to block the user interface.

<P>As you might know, &os2; is a "multithreading" operating system, which means that
a program can execute several tasks simultaneaously. &xwp; uses its "Worker" thread
(which is just a stupid, not a technical description) to prevent certain time-consuming
tasks from blocking your system. If &xwp; processed these tasks without the Worker
thread, the WPS would not react to anything until the task is completed.

<P>The Worker thread runs at "idle time" priority, which means that it only starts working
if your system has nothing else to do. This way, your system is not slowed down at all
although some time-consuming tasks might be performed in the background.
<IFNDEF __NOXWPSETUP__>
You can change the Worker thread's default priority on the "Paranoia" page in the
<A HREF="objects/obj_xwpsetup.html">"&xwp; Setup" object</A>.
</IFNDEF>

<P>Note that the Worker thread does some things which are not documented by IBM, especially
keeping track of all objects that the WPS keeps in its internal buffers. If you feel that
&xwp; is not working properly, you might try to disable the thread on
the "Paranoia" page.

<P>Among other things, the &xwp; worker thread is responsible for the following:

<UL><LI>supporting the eXtended Shutdown;

<BR><LI>in some cases, the "Full path in window title" feature;

<BR><LI>in most cases, the "Auto-scroll Tree views" feature;

<BR><LI>the &xwp; Startup Folder;

<!-- V0.9.19: removed this
<BR><LI>automatic recreation of the Configuration folders; -->

<BR><LI>proper updating of status bar presentation parameters.

</UL>This setting only has an effect after a reboot or a Desktop restart. The &xwp; Worker
thread will not be stopped or restarted when you change this setting.
