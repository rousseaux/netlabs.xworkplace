A "file system" describes the format in which folders and files are
stored on physical media.

<P>With hard disks, each volume can have a different file system.
The file system is determined when the volume is formatted. It can normally
not be changed afterwards without reformatting the volume.

<P>With today's operating systems, there are many different file systems
available, each with its own unique weaknesses and strengths.
&os2; understands the following file systems:

<OL><LI>Historically, the <B>FAT</B> file system (for "File Allocation Table")
is the oldest file system that was used on Personal Computers. It was
introduced with the earliest MS-DOS versions and is neither powerful,
nor fast, nor flexible, nor efficient. Its file names are limited to 8+3
characters and with large volume sizes, due to the internal management
of space allocation, lots of space is wasted. Even worse, FAT volumes
become fragmented very easily.

<P>Today the only remaining advantage of FAT is that
it is understood by nearly all operating systems, so if you have several
operating systems installed, you may use a FAT volume for exchanging data.
If you care for speed though, you should not place heavily-used data
on FAT volumes.

<P>With &os2;, FAT support is built directly into the &os2; kernel. No IFS
setting is required in &cfgsys;.

<P>Microsoft has later extended the FAT file system to allow for storing
long file names, even though this did not solve the other limitations
of FAT. Third-party drivers exist that allow &os2; to support these extensions.

<P><LI><B>HPFS,</B> by contrast, stands for "High Performance File System".
This is the unique file system that was developed specifically for &os2;.
It has lots of advantages over FAT.
Its file names can be up to 254 characters in length, it supports extended
attributes natively, it is a lot faster (hence the name), it doesn't
waste as much space, and it is very resistant to fragmentation.

<P>Compared to even more modern file systems though, HPFS has its
limitations too. Most importantly, &os2;'s standard <CODE>HPFS.IFS</CODE>
driver can only handle a  <A HREF="glossary/gls_caches.html">cache size</A> of 2 MB.
Considering the memory that is built into today's computers, this isn't
much at all.

<P>For HPFS support, the <CODE>HPFS.IFS</CODE> driver must be loaded
through an IFS statement in the &cfgsys; file.

<P><LI><B>HPFS386,</B> a highly optimized version of HPFS, does not have
that limitation. In addition, it is optimized for server tasks in that
it can transfer data directly from the file-system driver to network
drivers without having to go through a ring 3 transition. It also
supports local security, quotas, and limited software fault tolerance
support.

<P>However, this file system is only available at extra cost with server
versions of &os2;.
If installed, HPFS386 replaces the standard HPFS. It is loaded
through the <CODE>HPFS386.IFS</CODE> driver in &cfgsys;, but this
won't work if you do not have the &os2; server components installed.

<P><LI>For &warp; Server for e-Business (WSeB), IBM ported <B>JFS,</B>
the Journaling File System, from AIX to &os2;. By now JFS has been ported
to Linux too. JFS is now also available with eComStation and the IBM
&os2; Convenience Packs.

<P>JFS has the following advantages over HPFS:

<BR><OL><LI>It logs all disk write operations to a special log section,
the "journal". When the system crashes, JFS does not have to perform
a full <CODE>CHKDSK</CODE> to restore file-system integrity, but can
simply "replay" the journal it has maintained. As a result,
<CODE>CHKDSK</CODE> on JFS volumes takes seconds instead of minutes
or even hours, as with large HPFS volumes.

<BR><LI>It does not have the 2 MB cache size limitation of standard
HPFS.

<BR><LI>With the help of LVM, JFS volumes can be expanded without
having to reboot.

<BR><LI>JFS takes advantage of the new 32-bit code that was introduced
with the WSeB kernel (KEE32 and IFS32) and will thus not go through the
16-bit compatibility layer. JFS will thus scale much better
on multi-processor systems, but this advantage is visible even on
single-processor systems.

<BR><LI>All internal JFS structures are 64 bits wide. JFS therefore
does not have the 2 GB limits on files (and the 64 GB limit on volumes)
of HPFS.

</OL>The disadvantage of JFS is that it is not bootable. The &os2;
boot partition must still be placed on a FAT or HPFS volume. Besides,
most of the HPFS386 extra features are not supported by JFS either.

<P><LI>Finally, <B>CDFS</B> is the file system that data CD-ROMs use.
CD-ROMs use their own special format to organize data on disk which is
unlike FAT or HPFS, so another file system driver is needed.
This is implemented through the <CODE>CDFS.IFS</CODE> driver and is
used when data CD-ROMs are accessed. The &os2; CDFS driver supports
long file names in Microsoft Joliet format.
