<BODY>
<B>Object handles</B> are 32-bit integers which are supposed to be unique on the
system. The high-word (upper 16 bits) of the integer signifies the storage class
of the object (abstract or file-system), while the low-word (lower 16 bits) is a
unique identifier within that storage class.

<UL><LI><B>Abstract objects</B> usually have a high-word of <CODE>0x0002</CODE>,
and their low-word is listed in the
<CODE>PM_Abstract:Objects</CODE> section in <CODE>OS2.INI</CODE> with the
object's data.

<P>Abstract objects <I>always</I> have a handle created for them because they have
no file name and the handle is the only way to reference them.

<P><LI>By contrast, <B>file-system objects</B> (files and folders) only sometimes have a
handle assigned.
If they do, file-system objects usually have a
high-word of <CODE>0x0003</CODE>. The low-word then comes from the file handles
database in the <CODE>PM_Workplace:HandlesX</CODE> section of
<CODE>OS2SYS.INI</CODE>.

<P>Note that there are two <CODE>PM_Workplace:HandlesX</CODE> sections (with X
being 0 or 1). The WPS holds the file-system handles list in memory all the time
and flushes it to the <CODE>OS2SYS.INI</CODE> only from time to time. When it
does so, it checks the <CODE>PM_Workplace:ActiveHandles</CODE> key to find out
which of the two sections is currently active, flushes the handles to the other
section, and modifies that key to point to the other section then. This is necessary
because entries in the &os2; INI files may not contain more than 64 KB of data and
the WPS therefore has to use several blocks to hold the entire handles table.

</UL>To understand where all those file-system handles come from, some more
understanding of the WPS's inner workings is required.

<P>In theory, the WPS should only create a handle for a file-system object if this
is really needed, i.e. the object was really referenced somewhere.

<P>However, file-system handles can also cause problems. The more file-system
handles exist, the slower the WPS becomes in general. Most importantly, the
total number of file-system handles is limited. If there are too many file-system
handles, the WPS can become unstable.

<P>From my testing, file handles are created in the following situations
(in which the aforementioned API is called):

<OL><LI>From program objects and shadows. This is desireable because this allows
program objects and shadows to still point to the correct target object when
the target object is no longer at the original location.

<P>For example, if you enter a <A HREF="glossary/gls_path.html">path</A>
to an executable file in a program object's properties notebook, the program
object wants a handle, so it should get a new one when no one exists yet. The
same applies when you create a shadow to an object.

<P><LI>From other parts of the WPS (and &xwp;) to store object references.
For example, &xwp; uses object handles to remember your object buttons in the
&xcenter;.

<P><LI>Whenever an object is given an object ID (those things in angle brackets,
e.g. <CODE>&lt;WP_DESKTOP&gt;</CODE>). Object IDs are stored in the
<CODE>PM_Workplace:Location</CODE> section in <CODE>OS2.INI</CODE> together with
the object handles and can only be resolved if the handle is valid.

<P>The major problem with this implementation is that if the
file-handles table is broken, the WPS won't find the Desktop any more because
it uses the <CODE>&lt;WP_DESKTOP&gt;</CODE> object ID to locate it at startup.
If you get the "Cannot find Desktop" dialog, in 95% of all cases the file handles
table is broken.

<P><LI>From application programs which use the <CODE>Win*</CODE> APIs to create
Desktop objects or work with them.
This is normally tolerable if this affects only a few files.
Unfortunately, some of those APIs (such as <CODE>WinMoveObject</CODE>) require
object handles as input.

<P><LI>For every folder that was ever opened. This is also tolerable because the WPS
uses a folder's handle to store its position into <CODE>OS2.INI</CODE> so that
the folder's position is not lost when the folder is moved.

<P><LI>Automatically for every parent folder in a file's path if a new handle is
created for the file. This is due to the handle database's implementation which
only stores the short name of each file-system object and stores a reference to
its parent with the short name. This is very efficient because if a folder with
many sub-objects is moved, only a single entry in the database has to be updated.
The sub-objects only have a parent handle stored, which still works.

<P><LI>For each data file that is opened through a program object association.
This is because the WPS sets the <CODE>WP_OBJHANDLE</CODE> environment variable
to the handle of the data file that was opened. Some programs rely on this, but
this also has the unfortunate effect that a handle is created every time you
double-click on a data file even if the application doesn't need that handle.

<IFNDEF __NEVEREXTASSOCS__>

<P>&xwp; allows you to disable this behavior with its extended file associations.

</IFNDEF>

<IFNDEF __ALWAYSREPLACEREFRESH__>

<P><LI>Unfortunately, the WPS also creates handles for each
object that is refreshed during folder auto-refresh. That is, if a folder is open
and you do something in it from a command line (or another application does something
with files in that folder), for every file that changes in the folder, a new file
handle is created.

<P>A simple test case for this is to unzip a ZIP file into an open folder. This will
create lots of file-system handles which are probably never used again. Quite a
large number of file-system handles are created as a result of this behavior.

<P>And again, since object handles are never removed, these unnecessary handles will
stay on the system forever.

<P>This problem has been fixed with &xwp;'s replacement folder refresh.
