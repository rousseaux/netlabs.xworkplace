        Creating Objects with &xwp;

<!-- This is all new with V0.9.16 -->
<BODY>
In the default configuration, the <B>"Create another"</B> context submenu contains
items for creating Desktop objects. By selecting one of the items in this submenu,
&xwp; will create a new object in the folder whose context menu was used.

<P>Per default, if the folder is open, &xwp; will make the title of the
new object editable, just as if you had clicked on it with the Alt key pressed:
<BR><IMG SRC="img/titleedit.gif">
<P>However, if you hold down the <B>Shift key</B> while selecting
the menu item, &xwp; will automatically open the properties notebook of
the new object after creation.

<P>You can change this behavior on the
"Context menus" pages in the
<A HREF="objects/obj_wps.html">"Workplace Shell" object.</A>
