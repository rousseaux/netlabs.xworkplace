<BODY>
In the default configuration, the <B>"Create new"</B> context submenu contains
items for creating Desktop objects. By selecting one of the items in this submenu,
&xwp; will create a new object in the folder whose
<!-- V0.9.19: link added -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_popmenu.html">&popmenu;</A>
was used.

<P>By default, if the folder is open, &xwp; will make the title of the
new object editable, just as if you had clicked on it with the Alt key pressed:
<BR><IMG SRC="img/titleedit.gif">
<P>However, if you hold down the <B>Shift key</B> while selecting
the menu item, &xwp; will automatically open the properties notebook of
the new object after creation.

<P>You can change this behavior on the
<!-- V0.9.19: changed this -->
"Menu" pages in the
<A HREF="objects/obj_wps.html">"Workplace Shell" object.</A>

<!-- V0.9.20: added these links -->
