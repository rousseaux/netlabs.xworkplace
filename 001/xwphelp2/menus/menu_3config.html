<!-- This is all new with V0.9.16 -->
<BODY>
&xwp; allows you to globally add menu items to the
<!-- V0.9.19: link added -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_popmenu.html">&popmenu;s</A>
of all
<!-- V0.9.19: link added -->
<A HREF="objects/obj_fdr_main.html">folders</A>
on the system with the use of a special
<B>&cfgfdr;,</B> which looks just like any normal WPS folder.
Per default,
<IFDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
this special folder is placed in your &syssetup; folder.
</IFDEF>
<IFNDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
this special folder is placed in your "XWorkplace Installation" folder.
</IFNDEF>

<P>Whatever you put into this &cfgfdr; will immediately
appear in the &popmenu;s of all the folders on your system.
Note however that certain object classes have a special meaning in the
context of the &cfgfdr;:

<OL><LI><B>Program objects</B> in the &cfgfdr; will be started when the
corresponding menu item is selected.
(Actually, not the program object will be started, but the program defined in the
program object's <A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>.)

<P>&xwp; can perform a number of useful tricks on program objects.
See
<A HREF="menus/menu_4wpprogram.html">"Extra features for program objects"</A>
for more information.

<BR><LI>Putting <B>another folder</B> in the &cfgfdr; will
create a cascading submenu in the &popmenu;s. In this subfolder,
you can place more objects and folders.
This way, you can create a whole &popmenu; hierarchy (as can be seen in
the default setup).
There's no limit on nesting folders, so you may create hierarchies many
levels deep.

<BR><LI>A <B>template or shadow of a template</B> will result in the creation of a
new object from it when the respective menu item is selected. The new object will be
created in the folder whose &popmenu; was used.
<P>For example, if you have created a folder template with
special settings for fonts, colors, etc., you can put a shadow of it into a Configuration
Folder, and when you select its corresponding menu item from a folder's &popmenu;, a
new folder will be created in this folder, just as if you had dragged a folder from the
template.
<P>See <A HREF="menus/menu_2template.html">"Creating objects with &xwp;"</A> for more.

<BR><LI>A <A HREF="objects/obj_string.html">setup string object</A> will invoke
the setup string which is stored in the setup string object on the folder whose
&popmenu; item was selected.

<BR><LI><B>All other objects</B> will simply be opened when their corresponding menu
item was selected. This includes shadows of program objects, shadows of folders,
"real" files, shadows of them, and so on.
<P>For example, you can put a shadow of your favorite data file (e.g. "To-do list")
into the &popmenu;s.

<BR><LI>As a special feature, you can insert <B>menu separators</B> by putting a
program object with the exact title of <CITE>"---"</CITE> (three dashes) into a
&cfgfdr;.
Again, see <A HREF="menus/menu_4wpprogram.html">"Extra features for program objects"</A>
for details.

</OL>Note that the <CITE>"~"</CITE>
character within an object's title turns into an underlined character
in the &popmenu;, allowing for keyboard shortcuts.
