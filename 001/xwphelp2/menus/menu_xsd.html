With the "Shutdown" menu item in the Desktop's context menu
you can initiate the Extended Shutdown procedure which
is provided by &xwp;.-->

By shutting down your system all sensitive data in your system memory
will be permanently stored to disk before you can switch off your computer.
This also ensures that the settings of your Workplace Shell will be saved.
It is absolutely necessary to always perform this procedure before you switch
off your computer because otherwise some of your data might get lost.

<P>The &xwp; Extended Shutdown (&xshutdown;) provides a few extra features
over &os2;'s regular  shutdown procedure, such as automatically rebooting your computer,
<!-- V0.9.7: added this line -->
APM power-off (if supported by your machine),
and being able to cancel the shutdown procedure. Please see the
<I>&xwp; User Guide</I> for details.

<!-- V0.9.7: added this -->
<P>&xshutdown; can be initiated either from the Desktop's context menu,
<IFNDEF __NOXWPSETUP__>
if this
feature has been enabled in the
<A HREF="objects/obj_xwpsetup.html">"&xwp; Setup" object</A>,
</IFNDEF>
or from the respective icon in the "&xwp; Installation" folder.

<!-- V0.9.4: added the following -->
<P>If you have confirmations enabled on the "&xshutdown;" page in the Desktop's
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>,
you will see the
<A HREF="xshutdown/xsd_dlg_confirm.html">&xshutdown; confirmation dialog</A>
after initiating shutdown.
