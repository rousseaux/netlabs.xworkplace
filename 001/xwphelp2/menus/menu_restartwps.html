With the "Restart Desktop" menu item in the Desktop's &popmenu;
you can restart the Workplace Shell process only, without having
to reboot your computer.

<!-- V0.9.16: rewrote the following -->
<P>Selecting this menu item will close open windows, as if you had selected
the "Shutdown" menu item. However, afterwards the system is not completely
shut down, but only the Workplace process (<CODE>PMSHELL.EXE</CODE>) is
terminated and then restarted.
<!-- end V0.9.16 -->

<P>This can be very handy if you have installed WPS software which requires
a restart of the WPS, for example because the WPS class list was changed.

<IFNDEF __NOXWPSETUP__>
<P>You can disable this feature in the
<A HREF="objects/obj_xwpsetup.html">"&xwp; Setup" object</A>.
<P><B>Warning:</B> Before using this, be sure to read the respective section in the
<I>&xwp; User Guide,</I> which comments on some problems which might arise.
