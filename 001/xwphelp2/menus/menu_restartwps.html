        Restart Desktop

<BODY>
With the "Restart Desktop" menu item in the Desktop's context menu
you can restart the Workplace Shell process only, without having
to reboot your computer.

<P>After selecting this item, &xwp; will perform pretty much the same procedure as
with the <A HREF="menus/menu_xsd.html">Extended Shutdown</A>. The difference is that after
all windows have been closed, the system is not shut down, but only the Workplace process
(PMSHELL.EXE) is terminated and then restarted.

<P>This can be very handy if you have installed WPS software which requires
a restart of the WPS, for example because the WPS class list was changed.

<!-- V0.9.9: changed all the following -->
<IFNDEF __NOXWPSETUP__>
<P>You can disable this feature in the
<A HREF="objects/obj_xwpsetup.html">"&xwp; Setup" object</A>.
<P><B>Warning:</B> Before using this, be sure to read the respective section in the
<I>&xwp; User Guide,</I> which comments on some problems which might arise.
</IFNDEF>

<P>In the <B>confirmation window,</B> which is displayed if you have enabled
confirmations in the Desktop's <A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>,
the following settings are available:

<UL><LI>You may determine whether &xshutdown; should <B>close all sessions</B> before
restarting the WPS. If so, &xwp; will not only close the WPS windows, but all
other programs also.

<P><LI>You may also determine whether after the Desktop restart &xwp; should
<B>process all startup folders</B> again. If this is enabled, &xwp; will
process <I>all</I> &xwp; startup folders after the Desktop restart. By contrast,
if this setting is disabled, only those startup folders will be processed which
have the "Every Desktop restart" setting enabled in their respective
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>.

<P><B>Note:</B> You should only enable this setting
if you have either "Close all sessions" enabled also or if you're sure that
the programs in the startup folder are not currently running, because otherwise
they might be started twice.

<P>This setting does not affect the regular &os2; startup folder. That folder is
never processed after a Desktop restart.

<P><LI>If you deselect the <B>"Show this message next time"</B> setting,
<!-- end V0.9.9 -->
confirmations will be disabled for eXtended Shutdown and Desktop restarts.
You can then re-enable the confirmations in the Desktop's
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A> on
the "&xshutdown;" page.
