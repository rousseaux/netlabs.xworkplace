menu items.

<P>See <A HREF="menus/menu_3config.html">Configuring &popmenu;s</A> for
instructions about how to change the default setup with the use of the
special &cfgfdr;.

</IFDEF>

<UL>
<!-- V0.9.20: rewrote command prompts -->
<LI>The <B>"Command prompts" submenu</B> contains items for opening
<A HREF="glossary/gls_cmd.html">command prompts</A>.
If you select one of the items in this submenu, a command prompt
will be shown with the directory that corresponds to the current folder
already changed to.

<P><LI>The <B>"Create new" submenu</B> contains items for creating new
objects in the folder whose &popmenu; you have selected.
<!-- V0.9.20: link name changed -->
<P>See <A HREF="menus/menu_2template.html">"Creating objects with Create New"</A> for more.

<!-- V0.9.20: added this section for eWP -->
<IFDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
<P><LI>The <B>"Folder actions" submenu</B> contains useful items for managing
folders.

<P><B>"Show treesize"</B> will start the <A HREF="treesize.html">Treesize</A>
program, which calculates the total space consumed by this folder and all
of its subfolders on disk.

<P><B>"Pack tree (ZIP)"</B> will compress the folder and all of the contained
subfolders and files into a ZIP file. The zip file will be created in the parent
folder of the current folder and carry the folder's name with a <CODE>.ZIP</CODE>
extension. For example, if you select "Pack tree (ZIP)" for the
<CODE>C:\FOLDER\SUBFOLDER</CODE> folder, this will create
a <CODE>C:\FOLDER\SUBFOLDER.ZIP</CODE> file.

<I>&xwp; User Guide</I>

<!-- the following paragraph was added with V0.81 -->
<BR><LI>The <B>"Treesize" menu item</B> will start a program which will calculate

<BR><LI>The <B>"Netscape" menu item</B> will start Netscape, having it display
