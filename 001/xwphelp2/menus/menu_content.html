<!-- Changes for V0.81: see below. -->
With &xwp;'s folder content menus, you may take a look at the contents of a folder
without actually having to open the folder. This saves you space on your display.

<P>The folder content menus behave pretty similar to those of the &warpcenter;.
If you click on a folder icon, a submenu will open to show you the folder's
contents.
If you click on another icon, the respective object will be opened in its
default view (as if you had double-clicked on it in a regular folder).
If you click on a folder menu with mouse button 2, the folder window will be
opened (instead of the submenu).

<P>Please consult the <I>&xwp; User Guide</I> to read more details
about these functions and how to configure them.

<!-- V0.9.7: rewrote the following -->
<P>To get rid of folder content menus in folder context menus, disable the
respective setting on the "Context menus" pages in the
<A HREF="objects/obj_wps.html">"Workplace Shell" object</A>
and, for "favorite folders", on the
<!-- V0.9.16: replaced "XFolder" with "View" -->
"View"
page in a folder's <A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>.

<P>To enable or disable the display of icons in folder content menus, use
the respective setting on the aforementioned "Context menus" page.

<!-- V0.9.7: added the following -->
<P>To remove an object button from the &xcenter;, right-click on it and
select "Remove".
