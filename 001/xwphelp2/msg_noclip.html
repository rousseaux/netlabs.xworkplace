    </TITLE>

<BODY>
The program object in the &cfgfdr; that corresponds to the menu item which you have
selected has a <CITE>"%**C"</CITE> symbol in the parameter list.
This means that the contents of the clipboard
are supposed to be passed to the program as a parameter.
However, the clipboard currently holds
no text data: either it is empty, or it holds data of a different type (e.g. bitmap data).
<P>Click on "Yes" to start the program anyway; the <CITE>"%**C"</CITE> symbol will be ignored,
and no clipboard data will be passed to the program.
<P>Click on "No" in order not to start the program.
