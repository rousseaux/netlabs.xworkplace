<BODY>
The "Imported modules" page appears in the properties notebooks of all program files
(WPProgramFile class) and shows you the modules imported by the module.

<P>The page only lists the modules which are explicitly imported.
Neither dynamically loaded modules (loaded during program execution) nor
indirect modules required by other modules are shown.  (The former
is usually impossible to determine statically, and the latter depends on
the execution context -- things such as currently active <CODE>LIBPATH</CODE>,
<CODE>BEGINLIBPATH</CODE> and <CODE>ENDLIBPATH</CODE> all determine which modules
will be actually loaded.)

<P>If you want to find out which module is really used by a given program
file, you can use the <CODE>PSTAT /L</CODE> command while that specific program
is running.
