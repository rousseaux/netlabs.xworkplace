<BODY>
The "Treesize" program displays the disk usage of a folder and all its subfolders
in a tree view. If Treesize is started with a directory name as a parameter,
that directory is displayed, or the current directory otherwise.

<P>Per default, every folder on the system receives a "Treesize" menu item in
its &popmenu; (via the default
<A HREF="objects/obj_cfgfdr.html">&cfgfdr;</A>). This allows you to
quickly have the total tree size of every folder calculated.

<P>After Treesize is done with its calculations, you may drag and drop new
WPS folders onto the main window, whose size will be calculated then
also.

<P>Treesize offers you some settings using &popmenu;s. You may set
the sort order and the size display format. Also, you can determine whether
Treesize should also collect the size of all extended attributes, which
takes significantly longer.
