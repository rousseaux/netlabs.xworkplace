        Auto-Close Non-PM Sessions
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
In this dialog, you can determine which non-PM sessions will be closed automatically
during Desktop restart or the eXtended Shutdown and which method will be used to close them.

<P>Note that whatever you specify here only applies
to non-PM sessions; PM windows will never be closed by the methods you specify here.

<P>"Non-PM sessions" is the term used here for all sessions which are not controlled
by Presentation Manager, i.e. &os2; and DOS text-mode sessions in a VIO window or in full-screen
mode as well as &winos2; sessions.

<P>The settings you specify here will override the "Auto-close non-PM sessions" setting
on the Desktop's main notebook page.

<P>In order to specify the close method for a certain session, perform the following steps:

<OL><LI>Press the <B>"New"</B> button to create a new item, which will initially be titled "???".

<BR><LI>Enter the <B>title</B> of the session which you wish to configure in the respective
entry field. You must enter the title of the session exactly as it appears in the
&os2; task list (or VIO window title), so the best method to achieve this is to open
the session and to reproduce this title in the entry field.
<P>You may however abbreviate the title, and the session title comparison during Shutdown
or Desktop restart is NOT case-sensitive.
<P>Here is an example: if you wish to close the session titled
<CITE>"&os2; window (CMD.EXE)"</CITE>,
you may enter either <CITE>"&os2;"</CITE>, <CITE>"os/2 window (cmd.exe)"</CITE>
or <CITE>"&os2; WiNdOw"</CITE>. All of these entries will work. You should however enter
more than just a few characters, because otherwise &xshutdown; might apply your settings
to a different session which has the same leading characters.
<BR><LI>You may then select what &xshutdown; should do with this session:

<UL><BR><LI><B>"Skip session"</B> will <I>not close</I> the session, but skip it, as if you
had pressed the "Skip" button in the &xshutdown; status window.

<!-- V0.9.7: changed from "Send WM_CLOSE to PM window" -->
<BR><LI><B>"Close PM window"</B> will simulate selecting the "Close" menu
item in the session's system menu. This should work for VIO windows as well as
full-screen sessions, because the latter session type is also represented by a
minimized icon on the Desktop. This might however result in yet another
(regular &os2;) confirmation window whether the session should really be closed.

<BR><LI><B>"Kill session"</B> will kill the session without further discussion.
This invokes the <CODE>DosKillProcess</CODE> API on the session's process.

</UL>Note that neither of these methods will save the data of the session. If you wish
to have the data of a certain session saved, you should not enter its title in this
dialog, and you should neither have "Auto-close non-PM sessions" checked on the Desktop
main notebook page.
