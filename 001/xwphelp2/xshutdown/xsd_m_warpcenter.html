<BODY>
This setting determines whether &xshutdown; will give special treatment to the &warpcenter;.
This setting has been added with V0.9.7
because &xshutdown; caused resized Desktops on some systems
where, after the next Desktop startup, scroll bars would appear with the Desktop.

<P>If this setting is <B>enabled,</B> &xshutdown; will explicitly close the &warpcenter;
before closing the Desktop window. This is probably useful if you start the &warpcenter;
from a startup folder (after the WPS Desktop is up).

<P>If this setting is <B>disabled,</B> &xshutdown; will simply not close the &warpcenter;
at all.

<P>The checkbox is disabled if &xwp; was unable to detect the &warpcenter; on
your system. Reasons for this might be:

<UL><LI>You are running &warp; 3. The &warpcenter; has only been introduced with
&warp; 4.

<P><LI>The &warpcenter; object has not been awakened yet. This might be the case
if you are not currently running the &warpcenter; and the "System" folder has not
yet been populated.

<P><LI>The &warpcenter; object has been awakened during Desktop startup before
&xwp; was fully initialized. This might be the case if, on your system,
the &warpcenter; is started through the <CODE>AUTOSTART</CODE> setting in the
&cfgsys; file. In that case, &xwp; (and &xshutdown;) cannot
do much about the &warpcenter; in the first place.
