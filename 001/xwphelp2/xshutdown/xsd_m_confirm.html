This setting determines whether &xwp; will display a confirmation window after
you have selected "Shutdown" or "Restart Desktop" from the Desktop's context menu.
<P>Note that this setting only has an effect if the Extended Shutdown
or the Restart Desktop features are enabled.
<P>If confirmation is disabled, the "Reboot" setting above determines whether
&xshutdown; will reboot your computer automatically after shutdown is complete.
