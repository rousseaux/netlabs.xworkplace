If this setting is enabled, &xshutdown; will attempt to automatically switch off your
computer after shutdown has completed, instead of displaying the usual message
that you may now switch off your computer.

<!-- V0.9.7: changed all the following. -->
<P>This will only work if your computer supports this. For this, both your BIOS and
your &os2; must support at least
Advanced Power Management (APM) V1.1. The APM level of your system (and the APM.SYS
driver level version) is displayed on the shutdown notebook page for your convenience.

<P>If the <B>"Delay"</B> setting is also enabled, &xshutdown; will wait three seconds
before actually issuing the power-off request to the APM.SYS driver. This might
help on a few systems where the APM driver switched off the power before all caches
were flushed. If you get CHKDSK's after using APM power-off, you might want to
try to enable this setting.
