        &xshutdown;: Reboot Actions
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<!-- changed with V0.9.0: see notes below -->
<BODY>
In the "Reboot actions" dialog, you may tell &xshutdown; not to use its internal reboot
routine, but any other executable, which you can can specify.
The items you specify here will appear in the &xshutdown; confirmation window;
if you specify something different than "Default" in that window, the command
you have configured here will be executed instead of the normal &xshutdown; reboot
function.

<P>This is especially useful if you have the IBM Boot Manager installed, which comes
with &os2;. The Boot Manager can be activated from the command line by using
the <CITE>SETBOOT</CITE> command.

<!-- V0.9.7: added this line -->
<P>See the <A HREF="cmdref.inf#setboot">documentation</A> in the
<I>&os2; Command Reference</I> for details.

<P>In &xshutdown;'s context, the "reboot to" function of this command can be handy. This
function is accessed with the <CITE>"/iba:&lt;os&gt;"</CITE> option of <CITE>SETBOOT</CITE>,
with "&lt;os&gt;" being the exact name of
the operating system as it appears in the Boot Manager menu after system startup. By using
this option, the system will reboot without showing the Boot Manager menu, but starting
the specified partition directly.

<P>For example, if you wish to boot to PC-DOS 7 directly, which carries the title
"PC-DOS 7" in the Boot Manager menu, type at the command line:

<P><CITE>    setboot /iba:"PC-DOS 7" </CITE>

<P>Now, with this example, if you wish to make PC-DOS 7
a user reboot action of &xshutdown;, do the following:

<OL><LI>Press the "New" button.
<BR><LI>In the "Action description" field, enter whatever you wish to see in the &xshutdown;
confirmation dialog (e.g. "PC-DOS 7").
<BR><LI>In the "Action command line" field, enter the command to execute, in this case:
<BR><CITE>   setboot /iba:"PC-DOS 7"</CITE>
<BR><LI>Press "OK". The item will appear in the &xshutdown; confirmation dialog the next
time you attempt to shut down your system.

</OL>
<!-- the following was added with V0.9.0 -->
Starting with V0.9.0, a <B>"Partitions" button</B> has been added to this dialog.
This button is only enabled if a reboot action is selected in the list box on top;
you might need to press the "New" button before the "Partitions" button becomes enabled.
After pressing that button you will get a menu which shows you all the bootable partitions
on your system. Note that this only works if you have the BootManager installed, since
this will read in the partition tables directly and look for BootManager items.
Now, if you select an item from that menu, the currently selected reboot action
is updated with the proper title and command for <CODE>SETBOOT.EXE</CODE>.
<!-- the following is unchanged -->

<B>Important notes:</B>
<UL><LI>There is NO ERROR CHECKING, neither in the "Reboot actions" dialog, nor at the
time of shutdown. If you misspell the command to be executed or use <CITE>SETBOOT</CITE>
although Boot Manager is not installed, the system
will simply hang after all windows have been closed.

<!-- V0.9.9: removed this
The "Partitions" button has only been extensively tested with &warp; 4.0.
I have 17 partitions with six operating systems on three hard disks on my computer, and
the button works. ;-)

However, one quick check with &warp; Server for e-business (Aurora)
showed some problems: if you are using Aurora's boot manager, you cannot use this
function, because the boot manager's name table format has changed. If you are still using
Warp 4's boot manager, you cannot use SETBOOT under Aurora, because it will not
find the boot manager titles. -->

<!-- the following changed with V0.9.0 -->
<BR><LI>If you don't know the exact titles
of the Boot Manager partitions on your system and the "Partitions" button is not
working, you can start
<CITE>FDISK</CITE> (or <CODE>LVM</CODE> on Aurora) from a command line and copy them
manually from there.

<!-- the following is unchanged -->
<BR><LI>The command you enter here is started after all windows have been closed and the
INI files have been saved; however, file systems will not be released by &xshutdown; if you
select a user reboot. &xshutdown; assumes that the program you specify here will release
the file systems itself (i.e. call the <CITE>DosShutdown</CITE> API).
<CITE>SETBOOT</CITE> will do this, for example.

<BR><LI>The command you enter here is started via CMD.EXE with the <CITE>/C</CITE>
parameter. This
means that you may even execute a
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_cmd_rexx.html">REXX</A>
script here, if you're really daring.

<BR><LI>As always, if you wish to execute a command with resides in a directory not
included in the <CITE>PATH</CITE> variable, you must specify the full
<!-- V0.9.20: link added -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_path.html">path</A>.
For <CITE>SETBOOT</CITE>, this is not necessary, because it resides in the
<CITE>OS2</CITE> directory.
