        &xwp;: Save INIs
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.5 -->
<BODY>
With the "Save INIs" drop-down box, you can select how &xwp; should save
your user and system profiles (by default: <CODE>OS2.INI</CODE> and
<CODE>OS2SYS.INI</CODE>) on shutdown. This setting does not apply to Desktop restarts.

<P>This setting has been added with V0.9.5 to fix the problems many users had
during &xshutdown; with very large INI files (several megabytes). Unfortunately,
the OS/2 profile (INI) functions have severe limitations dealing with very large
files. It looks like these APIs run out
of shared memory quite quickly.

<P>For this reason, &xwp; has added its own set of functions which can save INI files
to disk. As a result, you can now select how INIs should be saved:

<UL><LI><B>"New method":</B> This will use the new profile functions which have
been added to &xwp; with V0.9.5 for saving the INIs.
These do not use shared memory, so the "save INIs" problems are less likely to occur.
This is the recommended setting.

<P><LI><B>"Old method":</B> This uses the &os2; profile functions. This is what was
always used by XFolder and &xwp; before V0.9.5.
<!-- V0.9.6: added these 2 lines -->
This was know to cause problems with large INI files. See the "FAQ" section in the
<I>&xwp; User Guide</I> for details.

<P><LI><B>"Do not save INIs at all":</B> This doesn't save the INIs during shutdown.
You will lose more recent system settings however during &xshutdown;,
so use this only if none of the other methods work on your system.

<P>&os2; dumps the INIs
to disk automatically every few minutes, so you will lose all settings which have
changed since the last automatic INI save. This is pretty
much equivalent to pressing Ctrl-Alt-Delete, which will not save your INIs either,
and affects all &os2; settings which are stored
in the INI files (Desktop objects, fonts, colors, application settings). So use this
setting with care.

<P>By contrast, icon positions and other information stored in objects'
<!-- V0.9.20: link added -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_eas.html">extended attributes</A>
will be properly saved.
