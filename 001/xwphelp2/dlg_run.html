<BODY>
The &xwp; "Run" dialog allows you to quickly run a command in the
specified startup directory.

<!--V0.9.16: added UL LI etc -->
<UL><LI>In the <B>top entry field,</B> enter the command to run. You can specify any
EXE, COM, or CMD executable file. If the file is on the
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_path_sys.html"><CODE>PATH</CODE></A>,
you do not
have to specify the file's full
<!-- V0.9.20: link added -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_path.html">path</A>,
but you may do so if you wish.

<P>The dialog maintains a history of the last 20 executables that were entered.
In addition, you may use the <B>"Browse"</B> button on the bottom to look for
a file in a standard &os2; "File open" dialog.

<P>While you are entering the path, you will notice that &xwp; validates
your input. The "OK" button will only be enabled if the executable file was
found. If so, right below the top entry field, &xwp; shows you the executable
file that would be executed when you then press OK.

<P><LI>With the <B>check boxes</B>, you may optionally specify whether the executable
should be started
minimized and whether it should automatically close on exit. This will only
have an effect with text-mode sessions.

<P>In addition, if you have entered a &winos2; executable, the check boxes
in the <B>&winos2; settings</B> settings group are enabled. This allows you
to specify whether the &winos2; executable should be started in enhanced mode
and/or in a separate &winos2; session.

<P><LI>In the bottom entry field, you may also specify a <B>working directory.</B>
If this is specified, &os2; will change to that directory before starting
the executable. This might be necessary if the executable requires access to
files in its own directory and that directory is not on the
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_path_sys.html"><CODE>PATH</CODE></A>
or
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_path_sys.html"><CODE>LIBPATH</CODE></A>.
If none is specified, the root directory of your boot drive will be used.
