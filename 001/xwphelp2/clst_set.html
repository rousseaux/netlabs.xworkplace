<BODY>
The "Class list" page in the "WPS Class List" object allows you to fine-tune
that object's display.

<P>If <B>"Show all SOM classes"</B> is checked, the class list will not only
contain the regular WPS classes, but <I>all</I> SOM classes which are currently
registered with the Workplace Shell process. This shows a lot lot more classes
and will take significantly longer to display. Except for <CODE>SOMObject</CODE>,
<CODE>SOMClass</CODE>, <CODE>SOMClassMgr</CODE>, <CODE>Contained</CODE>,
and <CODE>Container</CODE>, all of these additional classes are undocumented.

<P>This is probably only useful for curious SOM programmers. You will need to close
the "WPS Class List" object and re-open it to view the change.

<P>If <B>"Show method information"</B> is enabled, you'll get three windows in
the open "WPS Class List" view. The third window displays all resolved methods
for a selected class. If this is disabled, you'll get two windows only. This change
takes effect immediately.
