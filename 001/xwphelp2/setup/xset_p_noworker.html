        Disable &xwp; Worker thread

<BODY>
With this setting you can tell &xwp; not to use its background "Worker" thread for
certain features.

<P><B>Important note:</B> Many of &xwp;'s features RELY on this thread.
<!-- V0.9.9: rewrote the following -->
Enabling this setting will severely limit &xwp;'s capabilities; see
<A HREF="glossary/gls_workerthr.html">"The Worker thread"</A> for an explanation what the Worker thread
does. All those features will no longer work when this setting is enabled.

<P>This setting is only meant to be a "last resort" in case &xwp; does not work
properly on your system.
