<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.9 -->
<BODY>
The "Threads" page shows you information about the additional threads that
&xwp; currently has running in the WPS process. This might be of interest
for debugging purposes and bug reports.

<P>Each line in this container shows you the internal <B>thread name,</B>
which is only used by &xwp; to be able to identify threads by means other
than an arbitrary numer.
The <B>"TID"</B> value is the "thread ID" of the respective thread (which is unique
within the WPS process). The <B>"Priority"</B> value is the respective thread's priority:
the high byte can be a value of 1 through 4 (signalling the priority class: idle,
<!-- V0.9.13: changed the following -->
regular, time-critical, or forground server),
while the low byte shows the priority "delta" within a priority class.
(See <A HREF="glossary/gls_scheduler.html">"Processes and threads"</A> for details.)
<!-- end V0.9.13 -->

<P>&xwp; may start the following threads on your system:

<!-- V0.9.13: updated the thread names -->
<UL><LI><B>NotifySentinel, RefreshFindFolder, RefreshNotificationPump:</B>
these are running if you enabled "replace folder auto-refresh" on the
"Features" page and are responsible for watching the file system in the background.

<!-- V0.9.18: renamed media thread to Party -->
<P><LI><B>Party:</B> The &xwp; "Party" thread is responsible for multimedia,
such as playing system sounds.

<P><LI><B>Worker:</B> See
<A HREF="glossary/gls_workerthr.html">"The Worker thread"</A> for details.

<!-- V0.9.18: renamed Speedy thread to Bush -->
<P><LI><B>Bush:</B> The &xwp; "Bush" thread is asleep most of the time,
but suddenly wakes up for certain cosmetic, yet high-priority tasks which require
immediate attention, such as displaying the &xwp; boot logo.

<!-- V0.9.18: added Wimp thread -->
<P><LI><B>Wimp:</B> another idle-time thread which awakes only every few minutes
to perform some memory cleanup and such things.

<P><LI><B>File:</B> The &xwp; "File" thread becomes active when &xwp;
is doing file operations, such as moving files to the trash can or deleting files.

<P><LI><B>&xcenter;:</B> Since each
<!-- V0.9.19: added link -->
<A HREF="xcenter/xc_main.html">&xcenter;</A>
is running on its own thread, you will
see one such thread for each open &xcenter;.

<!-- V0.9.13: added this -->
<P><LI><B>PulseWidgetCollect:</B> this is only visible if you have the
<!-- V0.9.19: added link -->
<A HREF="xcenter/xc_pulse.html">"Pulse" widget</A>
running in an open &xcenter;. The pulse widget starts a second thread
for getting CPU usage information from the &os2; kernel in order not to be
blocked out if some application monopolizes the PM single input queue.
