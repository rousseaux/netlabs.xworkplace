        Disable Exception Beeps

<!-- new with V0.9.0 -->
<BODY>
Check this setting to disable the loud sequence of beeps that &xwp; normally
plays over the system speaker in case an exception occurs.
<P>
Many people have complained that they found these beeps very annoying, so there's
now a way to disable them.
<P>
However, if you normally don't hear these beeps, you should leave this setting enabled
because exceptions should not be taken as something to ignore.
