        Use "8.Helv" Font
    </TITLE>

<!-- new with V0.9.0 -->
<BODY>
This setting is mostly useful for &warp; 3 users.

<P>Since &xwp; uses the "9.WarpSans" font in many places to preserve space
in dialogs (and since the "System Proportional" font is so ugly), Warp 3 users
are a bit in trouble, because that font only comes with &warp4; and above.

<P>By enabling this setting, &xwp; will use the "8.Helv" bitmap font instead
of WarpSans. This is a quite compact font too and prettier than "System Proportional"
anyway.

<P>Note that you can also copy a Warp 4 version of <CODE>OS2\DLL\DSPRES.DLL</CODE>
to your system. See the "FAQ" section in the <I>&xwp; User Guide</I> for details.

<P>This setting works on Warp 4 too, of course.
<BR>
