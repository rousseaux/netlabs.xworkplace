<BODY>
The <B>"&xwp; Kernel"</B> group displays some information right from the internals
of <CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE>.
If consider the following explanations too complicated,
don't worry, an understanding of this information is not required for &xwp;
to run properly on your system.

<P>The <B>"Version"</B> field contains the version number of <CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE>,
including the date when it was built.
<!-- V0.9.7: removed this
(not of the language files!), while the "Build" field simply shows the count
of how many times XFLDR.DLL was built (compiled) on the author's hard disk
before being released, as well as the build date of your release.
That field might not be terribly useful, except when bugfixes should be released without
raising the &xwp; version number. -->

<!-- V0.9.4: removed this
The "C runtime locale" field shows the current language settings used internally
be &xwp;. This is not to be confused with PM's language settings in the
"Country" object or with &xwp;'s Language settings, but is only used for certain
C-language features such as string comparisons and sorting.
This should either be "C" if a default (English) locale is being
used or the value of your "LANG" environment variable in &cfgsys;, such as "DE_DE" for
Germany. For programmers: this is the return value of a
setlocale(LC_ALL, NULL) call (using the IBM Visual Age C++ 3.0 runtime
library). -->

<!-- V0.9.4: added this -->
<P>The <B>"Awake Desktop objects"</B> field shows you the number of objects which have been
instantiated internally by the WPS. Every time the WPS populates a folder (starting with
the Desktop at system startup), Desktop objects are instantiated in memory. This field shows
you the total number of objects which have been instantiated this way by the WPS since
the WPS was started. This number usually keeps growing as you open folders, since the
WPS rarely puts objects back to sleep.
This number is updated once a second. Open any folder which hasn't been populated yet,
and you will see this number grow.

<P>The <B>"WPS thread count"</B> shows the current number of threads running in the
Workplace Shell process (second instance of <CODE>PMSHELL.EXE</CODE>). This will
vary, depending on the additional
<!-- V0.9.13: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_wpsclasses.html">WPS classes</A>
that are installed. Also this number
might change if, for example, a folder is currently being populated.
This number is updated once a second.

<!-- V0.9.4: added this -->
<P>The <B>"Desktop restarts"</B> field shows you how many times the WPS has been restarted.

<!-- V0.9.9: removed all the threads stuff... this is now in 09992xc_threads.html -->

<P>The <B>"XSound status"</B> finally shows you whether &xwp; is able to play
system sounds on your system. This should show "OK". If you get something different,
system sounds will be disabled. Reasons for this could be that MMPM/2 is not installed
<!-- V0.9.4: changed the following -->
on your system or other problems occured with &xwp; multimedia.

<!-- V0.9.4: added this -->
<P>The <B>"XWPHook status"</B> field shows you whether the &xwp; hook has been correctly
installed. This should show "OK" if you have enabled the respective setting on the "Features"
page.
