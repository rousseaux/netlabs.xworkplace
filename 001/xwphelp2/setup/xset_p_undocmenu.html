        Disable Undocumented Menu Functions

<!-- This is all new with V0.9.6. -->
If this item is checked, some of the menu hacks in &xwp; are turned off.
&xwp; had to use some undocumented tricks to get certain things to work.

<P>Enable this item <I>only</I> if you run into problems with some of the WPS menu
functions that &xwp; introduces. This might solve some problems, but introduce more.

<P>Maybe among others, enabling this setting will disable the following:

<UL><LI>Collecting objects from a container when a context menu is opened.
This will probably break
retrieving correct icons for file operations such as "delete" and "move to trash can",
if these features are enabled on the "Features" page.

<P><LI>Folder content menus.

<P><LI>Menu system sounds.

<P><LI>Manipulation of Warp 4 folder menu bars.

<P><LI>Menus will close with all of the items in the "View" submenu which normally
keep the menu open.
