<BODY>
The "Objects" page allows to recreate the most important default objects,
both of the WPS and &xwp;, in case any of these got lost somehow or
were accidentally deleted.

<P>This page has <B>two "menu buttons",</B> one for the default Desktop objects, and
one for the default &xwp; objects. When you press one of these buttons,
a menu pops up which contains a list of the objects that can be recreated.

<P>These menus only contain the objects which are difficult to recreate,
mostly because they are instances of special
<!-- V0.9.13: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_wpsclasses.html">WPS classes</A>
which were designed
specifically for one system object. The menu does not contain objects which
you can safely recreate yourself using regular folder templates.

<P>If &xwp; finds out that an object exists already, the respective
<B>menu item is disabled,</B> and the path of the folder where the existing object
resides is displayed in the menu.

<P>Otherwise, the <B>menu item is enabled,</B> and &xwp; will create the
respective object when you select the menu item. The object will be
created on your Desktop, but you can then move it anywhere you like.

<P>Note that &xwp; uses
<!-- V0.9.13: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_objids.html">object IDs</A>
to determine whether an object
exists already. If the object exists, but does not have the correct
ID set, it is considered to be non-existant, and the menu item is enabled
anways. Be careful when recreating those objects, because some objects were
designed to be unique on the system.

<!-- V0.9.13: removed this
Please consult the &xwp;_User_Guide for a list of system
object IDs, which you will find in the "Appendices" section. -->
