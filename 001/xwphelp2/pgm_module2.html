<BODY>
The "Exported functions" page appears in the properties notebooks of all program
files
(WPProgramFile class) and shows you the functions exported by the module.

<P>For each exported function, its ordinal value, its type, and
possibly its name are displayed.

<P>Each exported function has an ordinal value, which is unique within the module.
The first possible ordinal value is 1, and the last 65535.  Not all
ordinal values correspond to an exported function.

<P>Each exported function has a type, being one of the following:

<UL><LI><B>Entry16:</B> a 16-bit function.

<P><LI><B>Entry32:</B> a 32-bit function.

<P><LI><B>286 Call Gate:</B> a 16-bit function that causes a ring 2 switch.

<P><LI><B>Forwarder:</B> a forwarder, that is, calling this entry point in
turn calls another exported function (either in this module or in
an imported module).

</UL>Some exported functions also have a name.  This name, if
defined, is case sensitive.
