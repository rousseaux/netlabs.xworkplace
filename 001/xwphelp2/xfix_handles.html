The Workplace Shell uses file handles as an internal database to be able to
find files no matter of their physical location.

<P>In principle, these file handles are a good thing. It is file handles which
allows for the WPS's superior features of program objects and shadows working
even after the files they point to have been moved to a different location.
Basically, this works because program objects and shadows never store the
physical

of an object, but only an object handle.

<!-- V0.9.20: moved all the rest to glossary/gls_objhandle.html, added
everything below -->
<P>For details about object handles, see
<A HREF="glossary/gls_objhandle.html">"About Object Handles."</A>

<P>Note that xfix mostly deals with file-system handles. To fix abstract objects,
you might use Henk Kelder's CHECKINI program (from the
