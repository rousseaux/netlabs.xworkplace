Templates are objects that are used exclusively for creating
more objects. Templates are easily recognizeable from
their icons:

<P><IMG SRC="img/template.gif">

<P>Objects that are created from template inherit the properties
of the template. In that sense, creating an object from a template
is similar to copying the template, except that the new object
will not be a template itself, but a regular object.

<P>To <B>create a new object</B> from a template, perform one of the
following:

<UL><LI><A HREF="glossary/gls_dragdrop.html">Drag</A>
a new object off of the template and drop it onto
the <A HREF="objects/obj_fdr_main.html">folder</A> where the
new object should be created.

<P><LI><A HREF="glossary/gls_dblclk.html">Double-click</A> on the
template to have a dialog displayed which allows to to select
the target folder for the new object.

</UL>The &link_tempsfdr; contains most templates that were created
when &os2; was installed.
Use that folder to create, among others, new
&link_folders;,
&link_progobjs;, or
&link_datafiles;.

<P>However, this is not a restriction:

<UL><LI>Templates can reside in <B>any folder.</B> The system keeps track
of them and can, for example, display matching templates in the
"Create another" menu.

<P><LI>You can turn <B>any object</B> into a template.

<P>For example, if you find yourself using a certain type of data file
frequently, you might consider creating a template for it. To do this,
perform the following:

<OL><LI>Open the document's <A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>.
<LI>Click on the "Icon" tab to switch to the "Icon" page.
<LI>Click on the "Template" box.
</OL>The icon of the document changes to a template icon, with the
previous icon of the object displayed in shrinked form in the middle.

<P>Similarly, if you find yourself applying the same properties to your
folders again and again, create a folder template that has these properties
already and use this template for creating new folders.
