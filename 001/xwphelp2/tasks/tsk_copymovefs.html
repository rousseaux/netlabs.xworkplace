<BODY>
When copying or moving file-system objects
(&link_datafiles; or &link_folders;)
between different drives, you should be aware of restrictions
if the drives use different <A HREF="glossary/gls_fs.html">file systems</A>.

<OL><LI>Other operating systems other (such as DOS or Windows)
will not be aware of &os2;'s
<A HREF="glossary/gls_eas.html">extended attributes</A>. This is
probably only a problem with the FAT file system since DOS or
Windows cannot see HPFS or JFS volumes in the first place. But
if you work on &os2; files with those operating systems, their
extended attributes might get lost.

<P><LI>If you copy or move a file from a drive formatted
with HPFS or JFS to a drive formatted with the FAT file system,
the system might truncate the file name according to the FAT 8+3
naming restriction. The original long file name is then saved as
an extended attribute of the file. However, if you look at the
disk with a different operating system, you will only be able
to see the file's short name.

<P>Be aware that diskettes are always formatted with the FAT file
system.

<P><LI>The automatic file name conversion described above only
works when you use the &os2; Workplace Shell to copy or move
files. If you use <A HREF="glossary/gls_cmd.html">command prompts</A>
(for example, the <A HREF="cmdref.inf#copy"><CODE>COPY</CODE></A> and
<A HREF="cmdref.inf#xcopy"><CODE>XCOPY</CODE></A> commands) to copy or
move files that do not conform to the FAT 8+3 naming restriction, the
operation will simply fail.
