&xwp;, "deleting" an object normally means moving it to the
<A HREF="objects/obj_trash.html">&xwp; trash can</A>.
The trash can collects all items that have been deleted and
allows you to recover objects that were deleted accidentally.

<P>There are several ways to delete an object:

<UL><LI>Select the <B>"Delete" menu item</B> from an object's
<A HREF="glossary/gls_popmenu.html">&popmenu;</A>.

<P><LI>As a shortcut, you can also press the <B>"Delete" key</B>
on  your keyboard to have the currently selected objects deleted.

<P><LI>You can also <!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_dragdrop.html">drag</A>
objects and drop them onto the trash can.

</UL><B>Remarks:</B>

<OL><LI>Some objects are <B>protected</B> against deletion. For files, this
can be the case if they have the "system" or "read-only"
<A HREF="glossary/gls_fattrs.html">file attributes</A>
set. Besides, objects of certain
<A HREF="glossary/gls_wpsclasses.html">classes</A> cannot ever be deleted
if they are crucial to the system's operation.

<P><LI>Deleting a <A HREF="tasks/tsk_crshadow.html">shadow</A> does
not delete the object that the shadow points to, but the shadow only.

<P><LI>If you want to <B>immediately delete</B> the selected objects, without
moving them to the trash can first, hold down the <B>"Shift" key</B> when
selecting the "Delete" menu item or pressing the "Delete" key. Be warned
that this operation normally cannot be undone: the selected objects are
destroyed for good.

<P><LI>Depending on the settings on the "Confirmations" page
in the &link_wpsobj;,
&xwp; will display a confirmation message before permanently deleting
objects.

<P><LI>If you prefer to always immediately delete objects, instead
of moving them to the trash can first, enable the respective setting
on the first properties page in the trash can's
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>.

<P><LI>There are ways to recover file-system objects that have been
accidentally deleted with the use of the
<CODE>UNDELETE</CODE> command on the
&os2; command line. However, this requires that support for this be enabled
first. See the
<A HREF="cmdref.inf#undelete">documentation of the <CODE>UNDELETE</CODE> command</A>
in the <I>&os2; Command Reference</I>.

<IFNDEF __NOXWPSETUP__>
<P><LI>You can disable &xwp;'s delete replacements on the "Features" page
in the
<A HREF="objects/obj_xwpsetup.html">"&xwp; Setup" object</A>.
