        &xwp;: WPS Class List
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<!-- Changes for V0.9.0: this has almost completely been rewritten, since we have
     a separate "WPS Classes" object now. -->
The "WPS Class List" object shows you the complete WPS class list as a hierarchical tree,
with lots of additional WPS and SOM information.
Using this object, you may register and deregister WPS classes as well as replace and
unreplace classes that have already been registered.

<!-- V0.9.13: added these 2 lines -->
<P>See <A HREF="glossary/gls_wpsclasses.html">"WPS classes"</A> for an introduction to
what WPS classes are all about.

<P><B>Warning:</B> The WPS Class List object allows you to make changes which will
render your system unusable. If you don't know the meaning of a certain class,
or if you don't know what WPS classes are good for altogether, you should <I>not</I>
make any changes here. You can safely view all information, but you should not
manipulate the WPS class list if you don't know exactly what you're doing.
Many changes that this page allows will make your system unstable
(if you're lucky) or will prevent the Workplace Shell from starting at all so that
you might have to re-install &os2; altogether. <B>In any case, make sure that you
have a made a WPS backup before changing anything.</B>

<P>The class list window is split into three subwindows, whose separators may be moved
using the mouse.

<P>If you <B>select a class in the class tree on the left</B>,
the two subwindows on the right
will show you additional information about this class.

<OL><LI>At the <B>top right,</B> you get WPS-related information, such as the class name,
the default class title (as shown in the third column of a folder's
Details view), and the DLL which contains
the class.
<P>If this DLL is on the LIBPATH, in most cases no additional path will be shown.
This applies especially to most WPS standard classes, which are
contained in <CITE>\OS2\DLL\PMWP.DLL</CITE>.
<P>Also, the "class default" icon is shown, which is usually hard-coded into the class.
This is the icon which is displayed per default if no custom icon has been set for
an object on the object's "Icon" notebook page.
<P>In most cases, if the selected class is known to &xwp;'s author, you will
also receive a short description of the class.

<P><LI>At the <B>bottom right,</B> lots of method information is displayed which is
retrieved directly from the SOM kernel (upon which the Workplace Shell relies to
organize its classes). This information is probably only of interest for WPS
programmers and pretty similar to the output of the fabulous "RWX" utility.
<P>
Depending on the selection at the top, this subwindow displays either all
the instance methods or the class methods of the currently selected class.
<P>For each method, you get the following <B>method information</B>
(you might have to move the container's split bar to view all the fields):
<BR><OL><LI><B>Method index.</B> This is used by SOM internally to quickly resolve
methods according to method tables. This is the index at which the method is
stored in the class's method table. Note that the same method does not necessarily
have the same index in different classes.
<P><LI><B>Method name.</B> Well, that's the method name.
<P><LI><B>Address.</B> The procedure pointer that SOM has returned when the method
was resolved. This pointer will differ for different classes
if a class has overridden a method, of course.
<P><LI><B>Class.</B> The class which introduced (first defined) the method.
<P><LI><B>Overridden by.</B> A list of classes which have overridden this method.
Note that only classes up to the currently selected class are shown. If any other
descendant classes of the current class override this method, this is not shown.
Select the descendant classes to view that information.

</OL><BR>Note that you can <B>sort</B> the method information according to four
different criteria for additional lucidity.
Right-click in the title-area of the method display (where the column titles are),
and you'll get a &popmenu; with the sort options.

</OL>You can make <B>changes</B> to the WPS class list by using
<!-- V0.9.19: link added -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_popmenu.html">&popmenu;s</A>.
Press mouse button 2 on any class name in the class tree, and a &popmenu; will
appear, showing you the available options for this class.
Certain options are disabled if &xwp; thinks that you should not make a certain
change.

<P>If you press mouse button 2 in an <B>empty area</B> of the left window, a different
&popmenu; appears. This one allows you to register a new class.
