<BODY>
The <B>"Define system sounds"</B> group at the bottom lets you manipulate the different
system sounds. The list box on the left shows all system sounds which are currently
defined (including the new &xwp; system sounds), plus an additional "Test" item
which allows you to test a sound. If you select anything in that list, the items on
the right (sound file, volume) will be updated.
<P>Note that the <B>"Sound file"</B> entry field on the right accepts multimedia
wave files via drag'n'drop. Alternatively, you can press the <B>"Browse"</B> button to get
a standard "File open" dialog.
<P>The <B>"Play"</B> button allows you to play the sound displayed in the "Sound file"
entry field. This button is disabled if the specified file does not exist.
<P>The <B>volume lever</B> on the bottom right finally displays the volume which has
been set. If <B>"Same volume for all sounds"</B> is checked, this will always display
the same volume; otherwise, the individual volume for the currently selected sound
is displayed.
