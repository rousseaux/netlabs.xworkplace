<BODY>
<IFNDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
&xwp; replaces the original "Sound" and (on Warp 4) "Sound scheme" pages
in the "Sound" object with a single, enhanced page, which combines and enhances
the functionality of the two original pages.
V0.9.16 The "look and feel" of the page
has been altered to be more like the Windows 95 sound settings, which (in this
one case) I have found to be very user-friendly.
</IFNDEF>

If you have the &os2; multimedia extensions installed, the "Sound" page allows
you to determine if system sound are played at all and, if so, which sounds are
played with certain system events. In addition, you can save your sound setup
as a "sound scheme" and load schemes that you have saved previously.
