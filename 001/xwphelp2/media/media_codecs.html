<BODY>
"Codec" is an acronym for "compressor/decompressor". A codec is needed for
compressing or decompressing the contents of an audio or video file. While
the <I>format</I> of a file (e.g. <CODE>.AVI</CODE> or <CODE>.WAV</CODE>)
is handled by an IOProc (see the previous page), the <I>contents</I> of
a file are handled by a codec.

<P>For example, MMPM/2 comes with an IOProc
for the <CODE>.AVI</CODE> file format, but it does not have enough codecs to
understand all compression formats which are typically used with AVI files.

<!-- V0.9.16 <P>The main problem of OS/2 multimedia is that we don't have enough codecs
to support all the modern compression formats.
That's why you can't play all types of audio and video with OS/2. -->

<P>The "FourCC" (four-character code) of a codec must match the one of an IOProc.
The same codec can be installed several times for several IOProcs. For example,
the "Intel Indeo" codec is installed for the AVI-file IOProc. But if you had
a new IOProc for some other video file format (e.g. QuickTime, ".MOV"), the same
codec could be installed for .MOV files as well, because the compression format
is the same, and only the file format differs.
