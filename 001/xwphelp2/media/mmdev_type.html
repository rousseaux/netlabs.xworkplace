The "Type" column shows you the type of each device.

<P>Note that with MMPM/2, a "device" can, but does not have to
be a physical piece of hardware on your system. For organizational purposes,
MMPM/2 creates "logical" devices as well to coordinate multimedia.

<P>MMPM/2 defines 19 media device types altogether, but this is rather theoretical,
because so far, drivers exist only for a small subset of these
categories. On a typical multimedia
computer, you will have the following devices:

<UL><LI><B>CD Audio:</B> A CD-ROM drive which is recognized by MMPM/2 to be able to
play audio CD's.

<P><LI><B>Wave audio:</B> Your sound card is recognized by MMPM/2 to be able to
play wave audio files.
<P>MMPM/2 uses IOProcs and codecs to decode those audio files
and send them to your sound card (see the "IOProcs" and "Codecs" page).

<P><LI><B>Sequencer:</B> This is what MMPM/2 calls its MIDI subsystem. This is
implemented thru your sound card as well.

<P><LI><B>Ampmix:</B> An acronym for "amplifier/mixer". This is a logical MMPM/2
device which mixes the various audio channels together and controls the volume
of the audio output. All audio output goes through this logical device. MMPM/2
needs the help of your sound card to implement this as well.

<P><LI><B>Digital video:</B> A logical device which plays digital video. This
can represent a physical hardware device if you have some special video hardware
on your system. On most systems however, this is implemented through software only.
<P>MMPM/2 uses IOProcs and codecs to decode video files and display them on the
screen (see the "IOProcs" and "Codecs" page).

<P>If you have the Netscape Plug-in-pack installed, you will have two such devices.
The second one is then responsible for MPEG video playback. For some reason, IBM
has chosen to create a second device for MPEG.
