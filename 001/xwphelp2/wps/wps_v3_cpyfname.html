-->
This setting determines whether &xwp; will add a "Copy filename" item to the
context menus of all file-system objects, i.e. all objects which have a physical
representation on disk. This includes data files, executables, and folders, but does
not apply to "abstract" objects (e.g. shadows, program objects and printers).
<!-- V0.9.16: Please see the <I>&xwp; User Guide</I> for a more detailed description. -->
