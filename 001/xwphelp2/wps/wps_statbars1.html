<BODY>
On this page, you may configure the status bar which &xwp; can add to your open
folder windows.
Changing the settings will
take effect immediately in the sense that all open folder windows will be updated instantly.

<P>The <B>"Enable folder status bars"</B> setting determines the default
visibility of status bars in open folder views.
You can override this setting individually on the
<!-- V0.9.16: replaced "XFolder" with "View" -->
"View"
page in each folder's <A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>.
This setting specifies whether status bars are visible if no individual folder setting
has been defined.

<!-- V0.9.4: added this line -->
<IFNDEF __NOXWPSETUP__>
<P>To disable status bars completely, disable the respective item on the "Features"
page in the <A HREF="objects/obj_xwpsetup.html">"&xwp; Setup" object</A>.
</IFNDEF>

<P>The settings in the <B>"Visible in..."</B> group determine globally for all
folders in which folder views status bars can be displayed.
These settings however only affect folders where status bars are visible,
either because they have been enabled for a single folder in its
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>
or because the global status bar setting is in effect for a folder.

<P>The <B>"Style"</B> settings let you decide what the status bar will look like;
just try out which style you like best,
all open folder windows will be updated immediately
if you change this setting.

<P>Note that the status bars also accept fonts and colors being dropped on
them from the respective palettes in the &syssetup; folder, which will update all status
bars instantly also.

<P>Press <B>"Undo"</B> to restore the settings
that were in use before you opened this notebook page.

<P>Press <B>"Default"</B> to restore the settings
to the installation state.
