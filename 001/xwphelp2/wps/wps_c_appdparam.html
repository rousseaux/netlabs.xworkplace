        Change Parameter List

<BODY>
This determines whether &xwp; is allowed to change the parameter list of a
program object which is started from the &cfgfdr;.
<UL>
<LI>When this box is checked, &xwp; is generally allowed to change the parameter list
of program objects residing in the &cfgfdr;. This applies to two features:
<P>First, &xwp; may append the folder name to the parameter list,
unless the last character in the parameter list is a percent ("%") sign. This feature
allows for starting Netscape with the current directory, for example.
<P>Second, &xwp; may replace a "%**C" key in the parameter list with the current contents
of the clipboard.
<BR><LI>When this box is not checked, &xwp; will not mess with the parameter
list at all. This way you can globally disable appending the folder names without
having to add "%" characters to single program objects.
</UL>
See the <I>&xwp; User Guide</I> for details.
