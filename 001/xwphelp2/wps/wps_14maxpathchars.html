        Limit Path to [n] Chars
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
This setting only has an effect when
<A HREF="wps/wps_13fullpath.html">"Show full path in folder title"</A> is checked.
<P>Enter the maximum number of characters that may be displayed for the path name
in the title. If the path name is longer than this number, it will be truncated.
The last part of the folder path (the folder "real name") will always be displayed.
<P>Example:
<IMG SRC="img/notrunc.gif">
<BR>might be truncated to
<IMG SRC="img/trunc.gif">
<!-- V0.9.19: refreshed this -->
<P>You might want to raise the default limit if you have a high screen resolution
or use a small font for window titles.
<!-- V0.9.19: removed this, no longer true
<P>Note that changing this setting will not apply to folders that are presently open (including
 the Desktop). Open another folder to see the difference. -->
