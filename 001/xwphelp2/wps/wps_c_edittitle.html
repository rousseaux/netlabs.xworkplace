        Make Title Editable
    </TITLE>

<!-- V0.9.16: replace XFolder with &xwp; -->
<BODY>
Selecting this setting will cause &xwp; to
make the title of an object editable, if you have created it from a
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="tasks/tsk_templates.html">template</A>,
as if you had
Alt-clicked on it. This happens only when the folder in which the object was
created is currently open, of course.

<P>This applies only to templates in the &cfgfdr;. Dragging
new objects from a template with the mouse will not be affected.

<P>Note that &os2; sometimes has problems with this, as the
title becomes editable for a moment and then, for some reason, the folder seems
to be automatically refreshed, and the editing mode is cancelled. On my system,
this appears to happen mostly in Tree views of folders. Sorry, this is WPS-internal.

<P>Even if you select this setting,
you can still always have the settings opened
if you hold down a <B>Shift key</B> while selecting the template menu item.
