<BODY>
This setting allows you to enable or disable automatic folder refresh immediately.
You do not have to modify &cfgsys; or restart the system for this setting to take effect.

<P>If the setting is <B>enabled,</B> all folders on the system will automatically
pick up changes in the file system after a short delay. For example, if an application
creates a file in a folder that is currently open, the file will appear in that folder
automatically.

<P>If the setting is <B>disabled,</B> such changes are not recognized by the
Workplace Shell. To have such changes displayed in open folders, you will have to
select the "Refresh now" menu item for the folder.

<IFNDEF __NOXWPSETUP__>
<P>Note that this will only work if you have enabled &xwp;'s replacement of the
automatic folder auto-refresh in the <A HREF="objects/obj_xwpsetup.html">"&xwp; Setup" object</A>
and have restarted the WPS after enabling that setting.

<P>This item is disabled if the replacement auto-refresh has not been enabled, or
if you haven't restarted the WPS after enabling the replacement yet.
