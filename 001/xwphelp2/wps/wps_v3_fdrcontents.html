This setting determines whether &xwp; will add a "Folder content" submenu to all folder
&popmenu;s.
See <A HREF="menus/menu_content.html">folder content menus</A> for details on this feature.

<P>Note that this setting will not affect the folders which you have declared to be your
"favorite" folders in the respective folder properties notebooks. In order to disable the
folder content functions completely, you will have to disable all favorite folders also.

<P>This setting takes effect immediately.
