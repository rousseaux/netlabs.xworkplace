-->
This setting determines whether &xwp; will add a "Folder content" submenu to all folder
context menus. By clicking on this submenu title, the folder contents will be displayed
in the submenu, including all subfolders, which will turn into subsequent submenus, just
like you might be used to it in the OS/2 Warp 4 &warpcenter;.
<P>These submenus behave just like the &warpcenter;'s do: clicking on an item will open the
respective object, clicking on a folder title will open another submenu, clicking on a folder
title with mouse button 2 will open the folder.
<P>Note that this setting will not affect the folders which you have declared to be your
"favorite" folders in the respective folder properties notebooks. In order to disable the
folder content functions completely, you will have to disable all favorite folders also.
<P>See the <I>&xwp; User Guide</I> for details.
<P>This setting takes effect immediately.
