        Enable Default Documents in Folders
    </TITLE>

<BODY>
This setting enables default documents in folders.

<P>If this is enabled, data files will have a new menu item in their &popmenu;s
allowing you to make a data file a "default document" for a folder. If a folder has
a data file which has been declared a default document, the folder will have a new
item in its &popmenu; which allows you to open that default document directly
instead of the folder. This effectively turns the document into a folder view.

<P>See the <I>"&xwp; User Guide"</I> for an introduction to this feature.

<P>Changing this setting affects all folder and data file &popmenu;s immediately.
