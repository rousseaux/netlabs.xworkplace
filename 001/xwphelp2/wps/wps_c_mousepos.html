        Create Object at Mouse Position

<!-- V0.9.16: replace XFolder with &xwp; -->
<BODY>
This setting will cause &xwp; to create new objects at the lower left
corner of the main &popmenu;, i.e. where you pressed mouse button 2 to
open the &popmenu;, as opposed to the next available free position in the
folder. This might take a little time of getting used to, but after this,
it's quite handy.
<P>This applies only to templates in the &cfgfdr;. Dragging
new objects from a template with the mouse will not be affected.
