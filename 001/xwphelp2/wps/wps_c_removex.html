        Suppress ''~'' in Window Title
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
If you put a <CITE>~</CITE> char in front of a character in a program object's title which
resides in the Configuration Folder, this
character will appear underlined in the respective menu item,
allowing for keyboard shortcuts.
<P>Unfortunately,
the <CITE>~</CITE> character will then appear in the title of the started window
also.
<P>Check this box to have the first <CITE>~</CITE> character in the window title
removed when the program is started. If, for a particular program object, you absolutely
need a <CITE>~</CITE> character in the title, put <CITE>~~</CITE> in the title,
and only the first one will be removed.
<P>This setting applies to text-mode sessions (such as command lines) only; PM
and WPS programs always set their window titles themselves, so this setting
will have no effect.
<P>This setting affects program objects in the configuration folders only.
<BR>
