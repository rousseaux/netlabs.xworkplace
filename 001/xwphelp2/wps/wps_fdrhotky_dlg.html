This dialog allows you to define a folder hotkey for a particular
folder command.

<P>Perform the following steps:

<OL><LI>Click into the "Hotkey" entry field. Press the key combination you
would like to assign to the new folder action. Note that the entry field
will only react if &xwp; considers the keys a valid hotkey combination.
For example, neither <code>A</code> nor <code>Shift-A</code> would be
valid, but <code>Ctrl+A</code> or <code>Ctrl+Shift+A</code> would be.

<P><LI>From the "Parameter" drop down, select the folder action that
should take place when your key combination is pressed in a folder.
