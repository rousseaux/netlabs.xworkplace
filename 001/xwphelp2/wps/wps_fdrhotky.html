On this page, you can configure keyboard
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_hotkeys.html">hotkeys</A>
<!-- V0.9.16 (shortcuts, accelerators, whatever
terminology you prefer) -->
for use within folders.

<P>The keys you specify here
will only function if a folder currently has the keyboard focus, <I>not</I> from within
other windows.
<!-- V0.9.20: added this -->
The definitions to this page do not modify the standard
<A HREF="wphelp.hlp#193">system key assignments</A>, but add up to those
definitions.

<P>Press <B>"Undo"</B> to restore the settings
that were in use before you opened this notebook page.

<P>Press <B>"Default"</B> to restore the settings
to the installation state.

<!-- V0.9.21: rewrote this paragraph, made it <ul> -->
<ul><li>The setting <b>"React to folder hotkeys"</b> determines the default
setting for whether folder hotkeys are enabled at all.
This setting takes effect immediately. You may override this global
setting for particular folders on the
"View" page in every folder's
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>.

<!-- V0.9.2: added this paragraph -->
<!-- V0.9.21: added <li> -->
<p><LI>If <B>"Show hotkeys in menus"</B> is checked, &xwp; will add a hotkey
description to &popmenu; items for which a hotkey has been defined. This might
be useful to remember all those different hotkeys. This will make the menu display
consume more screen space though.

<!-- V0.9.21: rewrote all the rest -->
</ul>In order to <B>configure</B> folder hotkeys, use the buttons under
the list of current folder hotkeys.

<ul><li>To <b>add a folder hotkey</b> for a particular folder action,
right-click on an empty
area of the window and select the menu item or press
"Add". A dialog pops up which allows you to define a new
folder hotkey.

<p><li>To <b>edit an existing folder hotkey,</b> double-click on the entry,
or select the entry and press "Edit".

<p><li>To <b>remove a folder hotkey,</b> right-click on the entry and
select the menu item or select the entry and press  "Remove".
