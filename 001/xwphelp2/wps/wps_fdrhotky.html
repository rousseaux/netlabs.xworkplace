<!-- V0.9.16: replace XFolder with &xwp; -->
<BODY>
On this page, you can configure keyboard hotkeys
<!-- V0.9.16 (shortcuts, accelerators, whatever
terminology you prefer) -->
for use within folders. The keys you specify here
will only function if a folder currently has the keyboard focus, <I>not</I> from within
other windows.

<P>Press <B>"Undo"</B> to restore the settings
that were in use before you opened this notebook page.

<P>Press <B>"Default"</B> to restore the settings
to the installation state.

<!-- V0.9.16: rewrote the following -->
<P>The <B>"Enable"</B> box determines the default setting for whether
folder hotkeys are active in folders. -->
<!-- end V0.9.16 -->
This setting takes effect immediately.
This global setting may be overridden for each individual folder on the
<!-- V0.9.16: replaced "XFolder" with "View" -->
"View"
page in every folder's <A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>.

<!-- V0.9.2: added this paragraph -->
<P>If <B>"Show hotkeys in menus"</B> is checked, &xwp; will add a hotkey
description to &popmenu; items for which a hotkey has been defined. This might
be useful to remember all those different hotkeys. This will make the menu display
consume more screen space though.

<P>In order to <B>configure</B> a certain folder action, click on an item
in the "Configurable menu items" list. In the entry field below, you will
see the hotkey that is currently defined for this action.

<P>If you wish to change the hotkey, simply click into the entry field
and press the keys that you want to set for the currently marked action.
You will see that the entry field responds immediately to keys you are
pressing.

<P>If you wish to <B>remove a hotkey,</B> select the respective folder action
from the list box and press the "Clear" button.

<P>Changing the hotkeys will affect all folders immediately.

<P><B>Important notes:</B>

<UL><LI>The entry field allows you to define hotkeys very freely.
It even accepts and remembers keys which might <B>not function</B> as folder hotkeys,
because they are already occupied by the folder container control (the area of the
folder window where the contents of the folder are displayed).
<!-- V0.9.19: remo ved this
The reason for this is that &xwp; only receives
a notification for keys that are not processed by the container already.
So if you try to define keys
which already have a default function in folders, such as the cursor keys or regular
characters (like "a"), the assigned function will not work. -->

<!-- V0.9.16: removed this
<BR><LI>The keys you define here might <B>conflict with other
software</B> which allows for hotkeys, such as Object Desktop. In general, it is a good
idea to split keyboard combinations: for example, give Object Desktop "Ctrl+Alt"
combinations and XFolder "Ctrl+Shift".

<BR><LI>Certain items in the list box require <B>OS/2 Warp 4.</B> They will simply not work
on older OS/2 versions, but cause no harm. -->

<BR><LI>The hotkeys do work even if you have
<B>removed the respective menu items</B> from the
folder &popmenu;s
(on the
<!-- V0.9.19: changed this -->
"Menu" pages in the
<!-- V0.9.4: link added -->
<A HREF="objects/obj_wps.html">"Workplace Shell" object</A>).
For example, you can remove the
whole "Sort" menu, but still assign hotkeys for sorting.

<BR><LI>Finally, the hotkeys which the entry field accepts might be
dependent on your system. Certain <B>wild combinations</B> (such as
"Ctrl+Shift+Alt+something") might not be recognized.
This is due to limitations in &os2;'s keyboard messaging and/or the keyboard hardware.
