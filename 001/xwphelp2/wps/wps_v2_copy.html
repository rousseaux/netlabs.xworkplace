<BODY>
Uncheck this box to remove the &os2; default "Copy" context menu entry.
<P>This setting affects all objects, including folders.
<!-- V0.9.16
<P>Note that on &warp; 3, this setting can only affect the context
menu of an open folder.
A closed folder clicked on with mouse button 2 will always keep this menu entry.
This has been fixed with &warp4;. -->
