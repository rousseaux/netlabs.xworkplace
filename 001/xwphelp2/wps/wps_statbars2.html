<!-- changed V0.9.0: see notes below -->
<BODY>
With the text fields in the <B>"Content of status bars"</B> group,
you can determine what will be displayed in the status bars.

<!-- V0.9.13: removed this
XFolder uses certain (not very intuitive, however flexible) codes to
display variable Desktop object information.
Please look into the &xwp;_User_Guide
to learn more about all the different supported codes.
All codes start with the "$" character. If &xwp; does not recognize
a certain text you enter here as a status bar code, it will simply be copied into the
status bar display, so you can also add informative text here. -->

<P>&xwp;'s status bars operate in <B>three different modes,</B> depending on whether
no object, just one object or several objects are currently selected in the folder.
For each of these three modes, you may enter any text you like into the respective
text field.

<UL><LI>The keys in the field <B>"No object selected"</B> determine what information
will be displayed if no object at all is currently selected in a folder.

<!-- V0.9.13: rewrote the following -->
<P><LI>In <B>"one-object mode",</B> &xwp; supports specific status bar
information depending on the <A HREF="glossary/gls_wpsclasses.html">class</A>
of the currently selected object. For example, if you select a program object,
the information will be different compared to a selected data file object
or folder.
<!-- end V0.9.13 -->

<P>Press the <B>"Select class..."</B> button to select the WPS class for
which you wish to set status bar information. The codes you then enter into the
entry field affect objects of this class only.

<!-- V0.9.5: changed the following paragraph -->
<P>If the <B>"Dereference Shadows"</B> setting in this group is enabled,
&xwp; will, if a single shadow object is currently selected, not display the
information for the shadow
object (which is pretty useless), but for the object which the shadow points to
instead.

<P><LI>The codes in the field <B>"Several objects selected"</B> determine
the information to be displayed when more than one object is currently selected.

<!-- V0.9.5: added the following paragraph -->
<P>If the <B>"Dereference Shadows"</B> setting in this group is enabled
and multiple objects are selected, among which are shadows, &xwp; will
use the information of the object which the shadows point to for computing
the "selected objects" sizes. Of course, this may give you a size for the
selected objects which can be larger than the size of the objects in the folder,
since the shadowed objects don't really belong to the folder.
<!-- V0.9.16 I added this per
user request with V0.9.5. -->

</UL>Note that all changes take effect immediately so that you can view the results
in an open folder while you experiment with the different status bar codes.

<!-- V0.9.13: added the following -->
<P>&xwp; uses special <B>codes</B> to display variable Desktop object information.
All codes start with the <CODE>"$"</CODE> character. If &xwp; does not recognize
a certain text you enter here as a status bar code, it will simply be copied into the
status bar display, so you can also add informative text here.

<P>The codes that can be used in the status bar content descriptions depend on
the mode that the status bar currently operates in. For detailed descriptions
of the various codes, select from the following list:

<UL><LI><A HREF="fsys/stat_4common.html">Common codes for all three modes</A>
<LI><A HREF="fsys/stat_5wpobject.html">Common codes for one-object mode only</A>
<LI><A HREF="fsys/stat_61wpfsys.html">Codes for WPFileSystem objects in one-object mode</A>
<LI><A HREF="fsys/stat_62wpdisk.html">Codes for WPDisk objects in one-object mode</A>
<LI><A HREF="fsys/stat_63wppgm.html">Codes for WPProgram objects in one-object mode</A>
<LI><A HREF="fsys/stat_64wpurl.html">Codes for WPUrl objects in one-object mode</A>
</UL>
