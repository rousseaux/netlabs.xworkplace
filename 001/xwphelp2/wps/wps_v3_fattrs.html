<!-- This file is new with V0.81. -->
<!-- Changes with V0.82: fixed the second line. -->
This setting determines whether &xwp; will add a new menu called "Attributes"
to all data file objects.
<P>In that submenu, you will be able to quickly set file-system attributes for
all the selected files, i.e. the "Archive", "Hidden", "Read-only" and "System"
flags which are normally only accessible on the "File" page in an object's
properties notebook.
<P>This setting takes effect immediately.
