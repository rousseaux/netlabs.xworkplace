Uncheck this box to remove the &os2; default "Create another" &popmenu; entry,
including the submenu which contains the items to create.
<P>This setting affects all objects, including folders.
<P>You can remove this entry without any problems
<!-- V0.9.16 , because I believe I have never used
it at all, and  --> because
&xwp; now provides a far more comfortable way of creating objects with the use of
templates in the &cfgfdr;.
