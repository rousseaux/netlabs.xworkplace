<!-- Changes in this file:
     V0.81:
        -- Added "set_254x*" files at bottom to make room for
           future extensions.
        -- Added one link, changed one link.
        -- Removed the A HREF="set_252x2sortbyext.html"/A
           reference.

        Note: because the link order has changed, the resulting
              help panels have also changed. If this file is
              not updated properly, &xwp; will display wrong
              help panels.
