With &warp4;, the "Refresh" menu item has been moved into a submenu, which is
not very convenient to reach.
<P>Checking this box will add a respective item to the main context menu.
<P>Note that this item will only appear in context menus of <I>open</I> folders. Otherwise,
refreshing does not make sense.
<P>Please note also that, in the default configuration, the "F5" key has been defined
as a hotkey to refresh the contents of the folder which is currently active.
<P>This setting takes effect immediately.
