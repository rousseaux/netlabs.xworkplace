<BODY>
This setting determines whether &xwp; will collect all the icons when displaying
folder contents, similar to the way the &warpcenter; displays its submenus.
<P>Disable this setting if you experience problems on your computer when folder
content menus are displayed. Some users have reported system crashes in this situation.
This is most probably related to video driver bugs, especially with the Matrox
Millenium drivers.
<P>Note that enabling this setting will significantly slow down the "Folder content"
functions, because collecting and displaying all the icons in a folder takes additional
time and memory.
<P>This setting applies to both the "Folder content" and "Favorite folder" submenus.
