The "Select by name" menu item lets you select only some of the objects in a currently
open folder view, while &os2; per default only knows menu items for selecting all or none
of the objects in a folder.
<P>Selecting objects is then done in a new dialog window, where you may enter a file
specification and then press "Select" or "Deselect".
<P>The entry field expects a file specification similar to those on an &os2; command line,
i.e. you may use the <CITE>"*"</CITE> and <CITE>"?"</CITE>
<!-- V0.9.13: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_wildcards.html">wildcards</A>
to select several
files. For example, if you enter <CITE>"*.txt"</CITE> here, all files ending in "*.txt"
will be selected after pressing <B>"Select";</B>
reversely, you may deselect only some files
by entering a specification and then pressing <B>"Deselect".</B>
<P>Even though we use the term "file" specification here, the wildcards also work on
abstract objects, such as program or shadow objects.
<P>The <B>"Select all"</B> and <B>"Deselect all"</B>
buttons do what they say: they select or deselect
all items in the folder, respectively.
<P>The dialog window only closes when you press <B>"Close"</B> or the <B>"Esc"</B> key.
It does not
close after you press any of the other buttons. This allows you to select several groups
of files.
