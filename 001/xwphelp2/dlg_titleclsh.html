<!-- changed V0.9.0: see notes below -->
<BODY>
This window appears when you copy, move, or rename a file and a file with the
same real name already exists in the target
<!-- V0.9.19: link added -->
<A HREF="objects/obj_fdr_main.html">folder</A>.
This applies to folders and data files.

<IFNDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
<P>&xwp; replaces the default &os2; dialog for this situation with a new,
improved one, which gives you additional information and additional options.
</IFNDEF>
&xwp; also remembers the last selection you made, which will automatically be
selected the next time this window appears.
In addition, the position of this window is saved, so that you may now determine the
position of this confirmation dialog.
<P>Select <B>"Replace existing object"</B> to have the existing object deleted and
replaced by the new object.
<P>Select <B>"Rename new object"</B> to rename the object that you were just working
on to something else. &xwp; proposes you a new title for this object so that the
corresponding real name will not conflict with other objects in the folder.
<P>Select <B>"Rename existing object"</B> to rename the object which already exists
in the target folder instead.
<P>Press <B>"OK"</B> to finish the operation using your selection.
<P>Press <B>"Cancel"</B> to abort this operation. No files will be changed.

<P>Note that the information on top of the window shows you the real name that has
caused the conflict, while that in the "rename" fields will be the new title of the
object. &xwp; will automatically convert that title to a valid real name.
In most cases however titles and real names do not differ.
