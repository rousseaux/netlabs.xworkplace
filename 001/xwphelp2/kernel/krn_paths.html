This page allows you to take a look at the most important system path entries
in &cfgsys; and find out which entries are invalid.
<P><B>Note:</B> Take extreme caution in modifying the system paths. One
invalid modification might render your whole system unusable.
<P>Press <B>"Apply"</B> to have the changes you've made written to the
&cfgsys; file. This will write the changes to all system paths available
in the drop-down box, not just the changes of the path that is currently
selected.
You will have to restart the computer to let the changes
take effect. A Desktop restart does <I>not</I> suffice.
<P>The <B>"System paths to check"</B> drop-down box offers you a selection
of system paths that can be modified using this page. The following system paths
are available (additional documentation can be found in the <I>&os2; Command Reference</I>):

<UL><LI><CODE>LIBPATH</CODE>: the "library" system path, which is searched every time
&os2; attempts to load a dynamic link library (DLL). This better contain the &os2; system
directories as well as a dot (".") entry, which stands for the current directory.

<!-- V0.9.7: added this line -->
<P>See the <A HREF="cmdref.inf#libpath">documentation</A> in the
<I>&os2; Command Reference</I> for details.

<P>Note that this is the only system path which is <I>not</I> defined using an environment
variable and can therefore not be changed from the command line. Use the <CODE>BEGINLIBPATH</CODE>
and <CODE>ENDLIBPATH</CODE> variables for temporary changes (which are not supported by this page though).

<P><LI><CODE>SET PATH</CODE>: the search path for executables (.EXE, .COM, .BAT, .CMD files).

<!-- V0.9.7: added this line -->
<P>See the <A HREF="cmdref.inf#path">documentation</A> in the
<I>&os2; Command Reference</I> for details.

<P><LI><CODE>SET DPATH</CODE>: the search path for data files. The use of this search
path is dependent on the applications; some applications use this, others don't.

<!-- V0.9.7: added this line -->
<P>See the <A HREF="cmdref.inf#dpath">documentation</A> in the
<I>&os2; Command Reference</I> for details.

<P><LI><CODE>SET BOOKSHELF</CODE>: this is evaluated by <CODE>VIEW.EXE</CODE> to find
online .INF books. Even though any INF book can be displayed, even if it's not on this
search path, the "Find" facility of <CODE>VIEW.EXE</CODE> will only find items in books
which reside on this path.

<P><LI><CODE>SET HELP</CODE>: this is evaluated by the PM help facility to display
help panels (.HLP files). Some applications do not specify the full path of help files
to PM in order to display help panels, which requires the help file to reside on this
path. &xwp; does not require such an entry though.

</UL>Once you select a &cfgsys; item, the paths that are specified with it
in &cfgsys; are displayed in the list box below. You can then select items
in that list box and use the buttons to have them modified. This should be
pretty self-explanatory.

<P>The <B>"Select invalid"</B> which select all path entries that are not
valid directories on your system. You can then press <B>"Delete"</B> afterwards
to have these entries removed.
