On this page you may change some &cfgsys; settings which determine &os2;'s
error handling.
<P>If the information on this page regarding the different &cfgsys; settings is
not sufficient for you, you'll find additional explanations in the respective chapters
of the <I>&os2; Command Reference.</I>

<P>Press <B>"Apply"</B> to have the changes you've made written to the
&cfgsys; file.
This will only change the &cfgsys; lines which correspond to the settings on this
page. The lines corresponding to the other pages in the "&os2; Kernel" object will
not be changed.
This button is only active if you have made any changes to the settings
on this page. Please note that you will have to restart the computer to let the changes
take effect. A Desktop restart does <I>not</I> suffice.
<P>Press <B>"Optimize"</B> to have &xwp; propose you new settings according to
your system characteristics.
&cfgsys; will only be changed after you press "Apply" also.
<P>Press <B>"Default"</B> to have the &os2; default settings displayed on the notebook
page.
&cfgsys; will only be changed after you press "Apply" also.

<P>If you enable the <B>"Suppress hardware errors",</B> those annoying &os2; error messages
about drives not being ready and other hardware errors will finally disappear.
When this is enabled, &os2; automatically reports the error which occured to the
application, which it would otherwise only do if you selected "Return error code" in
the white error window which then appears. This corresponds to the
<CITE>AUTOFAIL=YES</CITE> setting.

<P>Enabling the <B>"Suppress exception messages"</B> setting will result in exception
messages not being displayed in an error window, but instead they will only written to
the <CITE>POPUPLOG.OS2</CITE> file in the root directory of the drive you specify.
This corresponds to the
<CITE>SUPPRESSPOPUPS=x</CITE> settings. Note that since &warp; 3 fixpak 29
this file is always written to the boot drive, even if this setting is not enabled.

<P>If you enable the <B>"Automatically reboot after trap"</B> setting, &os2; will
automatically restart the whole system after one of those unrecoverable error messages
with "The system was halted." appears. This is helpful for machines which must
run unattended, such as network servers.
