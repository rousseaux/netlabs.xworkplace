<BODY>
The settings in the "Advanced" group allow you to control whether
&os2; uses high memory.

<P>Note that all these settings require that you are running an
Aurora kernel (that is, OS/2 kernel version 4.5 or higher:
Warp Server for e-business, Warp 4 with at least fixpak 13
installed, or an IBM "Convenience Pack", or eComStation).
Otherwise all these settings will be disabled.

<UL><LI>The <B>"Virtual address limit"</B> specifies the highest
address that &os2; will give to applications when they request
high memory (above the 512 MB line). This corresponds to the
<CODE>VIRTUALADDRESSLIMIT</CODE> statement in &cfgsys;
and may be in the range of 512 up to 3072 MB.

<P>If this is set to 512 MB,
which is the default (and the only available state with non-Aurora
kernels), high memory usage is disabled altogether.

<P>Values in excess of 512 MB will reduce the number of processes
that can concurrently run on a system.

<P>See <A HREF="glossary/gls_mem_himem.html">&os2; Virtual Address Space</A> for more
information on this topic.

<!-- V1.0.8: added bold -->
<P><LI>If <B>"Disable DLL basing"</B> is enabled, &os2; will ignore each
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_dll.html">DLL's</A>
base address (preferred load address) when the DLL is loaded. This
corresponds to the <CODE>DLLBASING=OFF</CODE> statement in
&cfgsys;.

<P>Enabling this setting may prevent fragmentation of the
shared arena and thus reduce the likelihood of running out of
shared memory, but performance for loading DLLs may suffer.

<!-- V1.0.8: added quotes -->
<P><LI>If <B>"High memory for Java"</B> is enabled, the &os2; Java
Virtual Machine is instructed to attempt to place its heap into
&os2;'s high memory (above the 512 MB line). This will
only work if you have set the virtual address limit above to
something greater than 512 MB.

<P>This corresponds to the <CODE>SET JAVA_HIGH_MEMORY=1</CODE>
statement in &cfgsys;.

<P>As with all high memory, this will prevent 16-bit code from
accessing that memory. Most notably, this requires that you have
TCP/IP 4.1 or higher installed.

<!-- V1.0.8: new option -->
<P><LI>If <B>"Early memory initialization"</B> is enabled, &os2; will
make the full amount of memory available to drivers earlier
in the boot process. This corresponds to the <CODE>EARLYMEMINIT</CODE>
statement in &cfgsys;.

<P>By default, there are only 16 MB of memory available during the
first phases of the boot process. This is regardless of the
actual amount of physical memory installed in the machine! The full
amount is only made available after all drivers have been loaded, shortly
before the shell is started. In scenarios where a large number of drivers
or very large drivers have to be loaded, the system might run short of
available memory. As a result, drivers requiring more memory cannot be
loaded anymore. Enabling the above option solves this problem.

<P><B>WARNING:</B> Do <B>not</B> enable this option if you use
the HPFS386 file system or older ISA hardware that directly accesses
memory e.g. ISA SCSI controllers. Doing so is likely to cause
data corruption.
