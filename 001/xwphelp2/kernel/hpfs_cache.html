<BODY>

The items in the <B>"Cache"</B> group determine how much KB of main
memory will be reserved for
the HPFS cache of the respective file system.
This corresponds to the <CODE>/CACHE:xxx</CODE> parameter in the
HPFS.IFS command line.

<P>The maximum cache size for HPFS
<!-- V0.9.20: replace drives with volumes -->
volumes is 2048 KB, which is not a
whole lot.

<!-- V0.9.5: changed the following -->
<P>You may request that &os2; <B>automatically</B> determine
the cache size. In most cases, this will then result in about 10% of the installed
memory, but it is not recommended to use this setting.

<!-- V0.9.13: replaced this phrase and link -->
<P>See <A HREF="glossary/gls_caches.html">"File-system caches"</A> for an introduction
to file-system caches in general.

<P>The setting <B>"Cache item threshold"</B> determines (in KB) the
maximum size of objects that will be saved in the caches. This
corresponds to the
<CODE>/CRECL:xxx</CODE> parameter in the HPFS.IFS command line.

This setting is supposed to prevent large files which are usually only loaded once from
clearing the whole cache.
However, the default value of 4 KB is way too low. You can safely specify
32 KB or even the maximum of 64 KB here.
