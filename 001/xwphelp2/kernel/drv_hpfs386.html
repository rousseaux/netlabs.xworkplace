        &os2; Kernel: HPFS386.IFS
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.5 -->
<BODY>
This dialog is used for configuring HPFS386.IFS,
which is the 32-bit version of the High Performance File System which
comes with &os2; per default.

<!-- V0.9.13

Over regular HPFS, HPFS386
has the following advantages:

<UL><LI>It's partly written in 32-bit assembler.
<LI>HPFS386 is capable of passing data directly to network adapter drivers.
As a result, data can be passed directly in ring 0 without having to go through
a ring transition, which makes HPFS386 ideal for servers.
<LI>Most importantly, you can specify cache sizes larger than 2048 KB,
which is the maximum with regular HPFS.
<LI>HPFS also can be used to implement local security on the file system level.
Access Control Lists (ACLs) can be stored directly with the file/directory structures
in the file system.

</UL>Unfortunately, HPFS386 only comes with the server versions of &os2;,
so only a few people can afford these advantages.

notebook. This does not change your &cfgsys; yet.
