<BODY>
The "Widgets" page in an &xcenter; properties notebook allows you to view
and modify the widgets in that &xcenter;. For an introduction about the &xcenter;
and widgets, see <A HREF="xcenter/xc_main.html">this page.</A>

<P>The widgets are listed in a details view, with the &xcenter;'s leftmost widget
on top in the list.
Note that you can <B>drag and drop</B> the items within the list to change the order
of widgets in the &xcenter; bar.

<P>The <B>"Class"</B> column displays the internal widget class name.
(Note that widget classes are not true
<!-- V0.9.13: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_wpsclasses.html">WPS classes</A>.
Only the &xcenter; uses the class names to organize widgets internally, but
the concept is somewhat similar, hence the name.)

<P>The <B>"Setup"</B> column shows you the current setup string of the widget.
Even though widgets are not Desktop objects, they save their setup internally with
setup strings similar to those of the WPS. This allows the &xcenter; to combine
all widget setup strings into its own WPS setup string so that an &xcenter; can
be recreated identically somewhere else.
