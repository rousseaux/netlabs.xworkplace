<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.7 -->
<BODY>
The "Widgets" page in an &xcenter; properties notebook allows you to view
and modify the
<!-- V0.9.19: added link -->
<A HREF="xcenter/xc_main_widgets.html">widgets</A>
in that &xcenter;.
<!-- V0.9.19: removed this For an introduction about the &xcenter;
and widgets, see this page. -->

<P>The widgets are listed in a details view, with the &xcenter;'s leftmost widget
on top in the list and numbered from 0 upwards. Trays and widgets in a
<A HREF="xcenter/xc_tray.html">&xcenter;: Tray Widget</A> are numbered slightly
differently - the format is <CODE>x.y.z</CODE> where <CODE>x</CODE> is the widget
number in the &xcenter;, <CODE>y</CODE> is the number of the tray in the tray widget,
and <CODE>z</CODE> is the number of the widget in that particular tray.

<P>Note that you can <!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_dragdrop.html">drag and drop</A>
the items within the list to change the order of widgets in the &xcenter; bar,
but not within trays themselves.<BR>
Clicking with mouse button 2 in a row opens a &popmenu;. This has options to
delete the widget and, if the widget's "Class" supports it, open its Properties.

<P>The <B>"Class"</B> column displays the internal widget class name.
(Note that widget classes are not true
<!-- V0.9.13: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_wpsclasses.html">WPS classes</A>.
Only the &xcenter; uses the class names to organize widgets internally, but
the concept is somewhat similar, hence the name.)

<P>The <B>"Setup"</B> column shows you the current setup string of the widget.
Even though widgets are not Desktop objects, they save their setup internally with
setup strings similar to those of the WPS. This allows the &xcenter; to combine
all widget setup strings into its own WPS setup string so that an &xcenter; can
be recreated identically somewhere else.
