The
<!-- V0.9.19: added link -->
<A HREF="xcenter/xc_main.html">&xcenter;</A>
"Sentinel" widget shows you a graph of the current memory consumption
on your system.

<P>The sentinel takes a bit of getting used to, but it comes in quite handy after
a while. Not unlike the <A HREF="xcenter/xc_pulse.html">"Pulse" widget</A>, it
shows you a graph of how memory usage has evolved on your system over time.
This graph is updated every two seconds.

<P>However, the sentinel shows you several graphs at the same time, in
different colors, with the current measurements (in MB) painted in the
same colors on the left:

<!-- V0.9.15: refreshed the image here -->
<BR><IMG SRC="img/xc_sentinel1.gif">

<P>The graphs represent the following:

<OL><LI>The <B>top value (in green)</B> is the <B>currently free physical RAM.</B>
This is the same value as with the <A HREF="xcenter/xc_mem.html">"Memory" widget</A>.
So if you have 128 MB of RAM on your system, this will never go above that value
(and most likely never reach it, of course).

<P><LI>The <B>middle value (in blue)</B> is the <B>currently used physical RAM.</B>
If you add this value to the top value, you should get your total RAM.
<!-- V0.9.15: (Yes, this
should be 128 MB on my system, but obviously I got rounding errors here.) -->

<!-- V0.9.15: replaced the following

<P><LI>The <B>bottom value (in purple)</B> is the <B>current size of your swap file.</B>
Add this number to the top two values, and you get the current amount of
virtual memory on your system.

<P>As you can imagine, this sum (the total virtual memory) can vary over time, as
you can see in the above screenshot. On the left, you can see that for some reason
the swap file grew really big, which made the virtual memory grow. &os2; then later
chose to shrink the swap file again. -->

<P><LI>If you have a recent <CODE>win32k.sys</CODE> driver from Odin (March 2001 or
newer) installed, the size of your swap file is represented by two more colors, as
in the screenshot above. The <B>third value (in purple)</B> then shows you the
the amount of space in your swap file that is currently in use. The
<B>bottom value (in red)</B> then represents the free space in the swap file.
The two values added represent the size of your swap file.

<P>As you can see in the above screenshot, more and more memory was allocated until
the free memory (in green) was used up. &os2; then started using free space in the swap
file (in red) until that was used up too. Then &os2; started growing the swap file,
which is represented by the purple graph growing. Finally, the memory was
gradually released, which was shown by the blue and purple graphs shrinking again.
Finally, &os2; started shrinking the swap file again since there was plenty of
free space in it.

<P>If you do not have a recent <CODE>win32k.sys</CODE> driver installed, you will
only see a purple color, simply representing the size of your swap file.

<!-- end V0.9.15 -->

</OL>The gray area above the colored graphs really has no meaning. It is
only the result of the scaling that the sentinel performs on the display. When time
passes, you will see that as soon as the "bump"
<!-- V0.9.15 -->
in the middle
<!-- end V0.9.15 -->
leaves the screen, the
display is rescaled and the gray area is then used for the display as well.

<!-- V0.9.15: removed this
<P>Here is another screenshot which shows you the memory consumption while &xwp;
was recompiled on my system:

<BR><IMG SRC="img/xc_sentinel2.gif">

<P>Since I heavily use a RAM disk for precompiled header files, it is quite obvious
that the free RAM becomes used up during the compile process. -->

<!-- V0.9.19: changed the following -->
<P>Note that you can
<A HREF="glossary/gls_dropfonts.html">drag and drop fonts and colors</A>
onto the sentinel widget.
Presently, you can only change the background color though.
Besides, it is
<!-- V0.9.19: replaced link -->
<A HREF="xcenter/xc_main_sizbar.html">sizeable</A>.

<P><B>Implementation Details</B>

<P>The source of the information that is displayed by the sentinel widget
depends on whether a recent version of Odin's <CODE>win32k.sys</CODE>
driver is installed.

<UL><LI>If <CODE>win32k.sys</CODE> was found, all memory information is retrieved
directly from that driver, which peeks into the &os2; kernel memory management to
find out those values. This is extremely efficient and also more detailed than
the alternative method described below.

<P>For this to work, you will need a <CODE>win32k.sys</CODE> build from March 2001
or later. Knut Stange Osmundsen was kind enough to add that functionality to the
<CODE>win32k.sys</CODE> driver for &xwp;.

<P><LI>If that driver was not installed or is too old, the sentinel widget will
fall back to a standard method for getting the memory information.
<!-- V0.9.19: added ifdef -->
<IFNDEF __EWORKPLACE__>
All the calculations of the sentinel widget are then based on two simple sources:
<CODE>Dos16MemAvail</CODE> (as described on the
<A HREF="xcenter/xc_mem.html">"Memory" widget</A> page) and the size of the swapper
file, which is determined periodically by doing a simple file-system call on the
swapper file directly. These values are directly represented by the top and bottom
graphs.

<P>The total amount of virtual memory (all three graphs together)
is simply calculalated by adding the amount of total physical RAM (which is
returned from the <CODE>DosQuerySysInfo</CODE> API and will never change)
to the size of the swapper file.

<P>The middle graph (the physical RAM currently in use) is simply the difference between
the total physical RAM and the currently free physical RAM.
</IFNDEF>
<P>Note that this implementation cannot show you free space in the swapper drive.
