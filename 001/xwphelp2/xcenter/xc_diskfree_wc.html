The

<A HREF="xcenter/xc_main.html">&xcenter;</A>
"Diskfree" widgets allows you to monitor the free space
on your disk drives.

<P>The &xcenter; "Diskfree" widget
in "&warpcenter; style" behaves very similar to the monitors in the &warpcenter;,
that is, you can click onto the widget to iterate through the available
disks.

<P>However, you can also switch the widget to "single" mode in its properties.
To do so, right-click onto the widget and select "Properties". You can create
several diskfree widgets this way to show you several drives at once.
