<BODY>
The &xcenter; "Window list" widget shows you the contents of the PM window list
as buttons.

<P>If a window is currently <B>active,</B> its button is displayed as if it were
pressed down.

<P>You can also <B>click</B> on the window buttons. Depending on whether the window
is currently active and/or minimized, this will activate or minimize the
application which the button represents. Minimizing works only for frame
windows which have a minimize button though.

<P>The window list widget accepts colors and fonts that are dropped on it.

<P>You can configure the window list widget to suppress the display of
certain windows (<B>"filtering"</B>).
Right-click inside the widget and select "Properties". A
dialog will pop up which allows you to filter out any windows that you don't
want to see.
