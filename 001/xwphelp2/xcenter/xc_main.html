<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.7 -->
<BODY>
The &xcenter; is a highly customizable, object-based bar on your screen
which you can use to quickly access objects on your Desktop and view
and change system information as well.

<P>The &xcenter; is intended to be an add-on or replacement to Warp 4's
&warpcenter;. That is, you can use it together with the &warpcenter;, or
you can use it all alone.

<P>Compared to the &warpcenter;, the &xcenter; has a number of advantages.
For one, you can have more than one &xcenter; on your system; secondly,
you can define what is displayed in the &xcenter; in a much more detailed
way.

<!-- V0.9.19: replaced all the following -->

<P>You can fine-tune some of the &xcenter; behavior, such as its display
style, in its
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>.

<P>The &xcenter; uses so-called <A HREF="xcenter/xc_main_widgets.html">widgets</A>
to display and/or access data.
