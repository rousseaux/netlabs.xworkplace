        &xcenter;: Introduction

</HEAD>
<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.7 -->
<BODY>
The &xcenter; is a highly customizable, object-based bar on your screen
which you can use to quickly access objects on your Desktop and view
and change system information as well.

<P>The &xcenter; is intended to be an add-on or replacement to Warp 4's
&warpcenter;. That is, you can use it together with the &warpcenter;, or
you can use it all alone.

<P>Compared to the &warpcenter;, the &xcenter; has a number of advantages.
For one, you can have more than one &xcenter; on your system; secondly,
you can define what is displayed in the &xcenter; in a much more detailed
way.

<P>The &xcenter; uses so-called <B>"widgets"</B> to display and/or access
data.

<P>To <B>add a widget</B> to an open &xcenter;, right-click on an empty area
on the &xcenter; bar and select one of the available widgets from the "Add widget"
submenu. Note that to add an
<A HREF="xcenter/xc_objbtn.html">object button widget,</A> you
can simply drag a Desktop object onto an empty area of the &xcenter; bar.

<!-- added V0.9.14 (2001-08-05) [lafaix] -->
<P>To <B>move or copy an existing widget</B> to another location (in the
same &xcenter;, or even in another &xcenter;), drag it to its new location
(and hold down Ctrl while doing so if you want to copy it).  Note that
some widgets cannot be duplicated, or cannot be placed in a tray.

<!-- changed V0.9.14 (2001-08-05) [lafaix] -->
<P>To <B>remove a widget,</B> right-click on it and select "Remove widget", or
drag it to the shredder.

<P>Some widgets are <B>sizeable.</B> If, when moving the mouse pointer to the
right edge of a widget, the mouse pointer changes to a "west-east" pointer,
you can resize that widget.

<P>You can fine-tune some of the global &xcenter; data in its
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>.

<!-- added the following two para V0.9.14 (2001-08-05) [lafaix] -->
<P>To <B>save a widget,</B> drag it to the Desktop (or to a folder on the
Desktop). This will create a data file with the widget's class and setup
string.

<P>To <B>restore a saved widget,</B> drag it from the Desktop to its
location in the &xcenter;, and hold down Ctrl while doing so.  Note that
some widgets cannot be duplicated, or cannot be placed in a tray.
