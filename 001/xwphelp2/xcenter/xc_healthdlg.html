The "Health Monitor Settings" dialog allows you to specify what is displayed
in the Health widget.
<P>You'll have to enter a setup string here. There are several special "tokens" that
are replaced by specific values.
<P>Currently valid replacement values are:
<P>%T&lt;n&gt; Replaced by temperature value in Celsius of sensor n (0-9)
<P>%TF&lt;n&gt; Replaced by temperature value in Fahrenheit of sensor n (0-9)
<P>%F&lt;n&gt; Replaced by fan value of sensor n (0-9)
<P>%V&lt;n&gt; Replaced by voltage value of sensor n (0-9)
<P>If a sensor is not supported the value will be shown as "[ERR]"
<P>Example: "Temperature %T0 øC and Fan %F2 RPM"
<P>Sample output: "Temperature 30.00 øC and Fan 4818 RPM"
