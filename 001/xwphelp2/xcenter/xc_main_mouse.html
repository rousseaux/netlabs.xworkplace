        &xcenter;: Mouse Operations

<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.19 -->
<BODY>
The way the &xcenter; interprets mouse clicks depends on
whether the click occured on a
<A HREF="xcenter/xc_main_widgets.html">widget</A>.

<UL><LI>Clicking <B>inside a widget</B> will operate on the widget.

<P>For example, clicking on a widget with mouse button 2 will open
the widget's context menu.

<P><LI>Clicking <B>anywhere outside a widget</B> will operate on
the &xcenter; itself. If you have any empty space left in your
&xcenter; this applies to, for example, clicking into that empty
space. If there is no empty space left, to operate on the &xcenter;,
click onto the very left or the very right of the &xcenter; bar.

<P>For example, to open the context menu of the &xcenter; itself,
click onto the &xcenter; bar on the very left of the screen.

</UL>To manipulate widgets
using the mouse, do the following:

<UL><LI>To <B>move or copy an existing widget</B> to another location (in the
same &xcenter;, or even in another &xcenter;), drag it to its new location
(and hold down Ctrl while doing so if you want to copy it).  Note that
some widgets cannot be duplicated, or cannot be placed in a
<A HREF="xcenter/xc_tray.html">tray</A>.

<P><LI>To <B>remove a widget,</B> click on it with mouse button 2 and select
"Remove widget", or drag it to the shredder.

<P><LI>Some widgets are <B>sizeable.</B> If, when moving the mouse pointer over
the right edge of a widget, the mouse pointer changes to a "west-east" pointer,
you can resize that widget.

<P><LI>To <B>save a widget,</B> drag it to the Desktop (or to a folder on the
Desktop). This will create a data file with the widget's class and setup
string.

<P><LI>To <B>restore a saved widget,</B> drag it from the Desktop to its
location in the &xcenter;, and hold down Ctrl while doing so.  Note that
some widgets cannot be duplicated, or cannot be placed in a tray.
