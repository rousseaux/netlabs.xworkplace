"object button" widget displays a button which represents any
Desktop object.

<UL><LI>If that Desktop object is a folder, you can click on the button and view the
<!-- V0.9.19: replaced this -->
<A HREF="menus/menu_content.html">folder's contents</A>.

<P><LI>If that Desktop object is not a folder, you can open the object in its default
view by clicking on the button.

</UL>Object button widgets can easily be added to any position in the &xcenter;
by dragging any Desktop object onto an empty area of the &xcenter; bar:
<P><IMG SRC="img/xc_drag.gif">
This will
create an object button widget at the position where the Desktop object was dropped.
