<BODY>
The <B>"View thread priority"</B> allows you to specify the priority delta
of the thread that is started when the &xcenter; is opened.

<P>The &xcenter; does not run on the same thread as most other WPS windows
-- which is normally thread 1 in the WPS process. Instead, when an &xcenter;
is opened, a new thread is created. This way we can control the priority
of the &xcenter; display independently from the rest of the WPS.

<P>Note that the &xcenter; will always use the "regular" priority class to
avoid system hangs and side effects with other software.
Only within that class you may alter the priority delta between zero and 31.

<P>Per default, the &xcenter; runs with a priority delta of zero, which is
the standard priority delta (and the same as all other WPS windows).
However, you can raise that delta up to 31 (which is the maximum priority
delta in &os2;) to give the &xcenter; precendence over other tasks in the system.
Among other things, this might make animations run more smoothly.
