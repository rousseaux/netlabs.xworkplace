<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.2 -->
<!-- V0.9.4: replace all "screen corners" with "screen borders" -->
<!-- V0.9.9: added &pgr; special functions -->
<!-- V0.9.9: added corner sensitivity setting -->

<!-- V0.9.19: changed the following paragraph -->
The "Screen borders" allows you to have a special action take place if the
mouse is moved to one of the screen corners or borders. For example, you
can tell the system to automatically open the "Drives" folder if the mouse
is moved to the top right corner of the screen.

<P>All settings on this page take effect immediately.

<P>Press <B>"Undo"</B> to restore the settings that were in use before
you opened this notebook page.

<P>Press <B>"Default"</B> to restore the settings to the installation state.
This will disable all features on this page.

<!-- V0.9.19: removed this
<P>The settings on this page affect the &xwp; "screen border objects" feature.
This allows you to have a special action take place if the mouse is moved to one of
the screen corners or borders. -->

<P>In order to configure screen borders, two steps are required:

<OL><LI>First, click on one of the radio buttons in the <B>"Screen borders" group</B>
to select the screen corner or border you wish to configure.

<P><LI>Then, from the <B>"Action" group,</B> select the action which should
occur when the mouse is moved to that border:

<BR><UL><LI><B>"Inactive"</B> means that the screen border is disabled -- that is,
nothing happens when the mouse is moved there. This is the default.

<P><LI>By selecting <B>"Open object",</B> the white field below becomes active.
Drag and drop any Desktop object into the white field to make it an active
"screen border object" -- that is, if the mouse is moved to the screen corner or border you
are currently configuring, that object will be opened in its default view, as if
you had double-clicked upon it.

<!-- V0.9.19: added this paragraph -->
<P><B>Note:</B> Any &xcenter; automatically becomes a screen border object for either
the top or the bottom screen border when it is opened. Whatever you have previously
set for either the top or the bottom border is therefore overwritten when an
&xcenter; opens.

<P><LI>By selecting <B>"Special function",</B> the drop-down box below becomes
active. Select a special function from that box in order to have that function
performed when the mouse is moved to the corner or border you are currently configuring.
You can select to have either the window list or the Desktop's
<!-- V0.9.19: link added -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_popmenu.html">&popmenu;</A>
displayed in the active screen corner or border.
<!-- V0.9.19: added ifdef -->
<IFNDEF __NOPAGER__>
<!-- V 0.9.4: added the following -->
In addition, you can have the &pgr; window pop up if &pgr; is enabled. This
is especially useful if you are using the "Flash to top" feature of &pgr;.
<!-- V0.9.9: added the following -->
Also, if you want a panning virtual desktop, you can associate the "One screen up",
"One screen right", "One screen down", and "One screen left" functions to the
respectives corners.
</IFNDEF>

<!-- V0.9.9: added the following -->
</UL></OL>The <B>"Corner sensitivity"</B> setting allows to specify how much
of the screen borders, counting from the "real" corners, are sensitive to the
corner settings. If you specify 0%, then corners are disabled. If you specify
50%, then borders are disabled.  This setting defaults to 30%.

<P>For example, with the upper border and a screen resolution of 800x600,
a corner sensitivity setting of 30% would mean that the first 240 pixels
are assumed to be part of the upper <I>left corner,</I> the next 320 pixels the
upper <I>border,</I> and the last 240 pixels the upper <I>right corner.</I>
