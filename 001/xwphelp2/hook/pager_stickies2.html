<BODY>
PageMage will treat a window as being sticky if its
<B>switch list title</B> matches an entry on the list on this page.
The switch list title is always shown in the switch list (window list, which
appears after pressing Ctrl+Esc).

<P><B>Note:</B> The switch list frequently shows both the window title and the
switch list title, separated by a dash. If both appear, PageMage will use
the title which appears after the dash.
