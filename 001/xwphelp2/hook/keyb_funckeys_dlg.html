<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.3 -->
<BODY>
This dialog allows you to edit a function key. The dialog is the same both if
you are adding a new function key or editing an existing one.

<P>In the <B>"Description"</B> field, enter any description for that key. For example,
if you have one of those "Multimedia" keyboards and your keyboard has a key named
"Eject", type "Eject". This description will describe the function key in the various
hotkey descriptions in &xwp;, such as the
<!-- V0.9.16: change "Object" to "Icon" -->
"Icon"
page in all object properties
notebooks and on the "Hotkeys" page in the "Keyboard" settings object. It has no
meaning otherwise, the function key will work no matter what you type in here.

<P>To actually register the function key with &xwp;, click into the red
<B>"Hardware scan code"</B> entry field. Once the field has the cursor, press the
function key once. This will show you the hardware scan code of the key you pressed.
See the <I>&xwp; User Guide</I> for a description what this means.

<!-- V1.0.5: Remove this paragraph
<P>If you check the <B>"Modifier key"</B> box, the function key will be registered
as a modifier key. This means that it is supposed to function similar to the
"Shift", "Ctrl", and "Alt" keys, which can be pressed together with some regular key.
Still, you can use this key as a standalone hotkey as well.
-->

<P>Once you press <B>"OK"</B>, the function key will be registered with the &xwp;
hook immediately so you can then use it as a global object hotkey.

<P>Press <B>"Cancel"</B> in order not to register the key.
