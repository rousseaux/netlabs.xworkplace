<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.4 -->
<BODY>
If <B>"Flash to top"</B> is enabled, the PageMage window will temporarily move itself
on top of all other windows when desktops are switched. This happens either if you
move to another desktop using the desktop hotkeys or if a window gets activated which
is on another desktop.

<P>This setting allows you to preserve space on your screen because the PageMage window
will only show up when it's needed.

<P>With the <B>"Delay"</B> setting you may specify (in seconds) how long the
PageMage window will show before it hides again.

<P><B>Note:</B> Since the PageMage window will keep disappearing if this setting is
enabled, a new "special function" has been added to the &xwp; "screen borders"
feature which allows you to have the PageMage window show up when the mouse is moved
to a screen corner or border. This can be added on the second "Movement" page in
the enhanced "Mouse" object.
