<BODY>
If <B>"Flash to top"</B> is enabled, the &pgr; window will temporarily move itself
on top of all other windows when desktops are switched. This happens either if you
move to another desktop using the desktop hotkeys or if a window gets activated which
is on another desktop.

<P>This setting allows you to preserve space on your screen because the &pgr; window
will only show up when it's needed.

<P>With the <B>"Delay"</B> setting you may specify (in seconds) how long the
&pgr; window will show before it hides again.

<P><B>Note:</B> Since the &pgr; window will keep disappearing if this setting is
enabled, you can still see the &pgr; window when the mouse is moved to a screen
corner or border via a "special function" in the &xwp; "screen borders" feature.
