The <B>"MB3 click action"</B> drow-down list allows to assign
a specific action to mouse-button-3 (MB3) clicks:

<UL><LI>If <B>"AutoScroll"</B> is selected, then all MB3 clicks start
the autoscroll mode if the mouse pointer is over a scrollable area.
While in auto-scroll mode, moving the pointer scrolls the area.  The farthest
the pointer is from its initial position, the fastest the area scrolls.
Clicking any mouse button exits the autoscroll mode.

<P><B>Note:</B> This does not interfere with the "MB3 drag scrolling" settings below
that determine what happens when you <I>drag</I> the mouse while mouse button 3
is down. You can have AutoScroll enabled and drag-scrolling disabled, and vice
versa.

<P><LI>If <B>"Double click"</B> is selected, then all MB3 clicks will
be converted to mouse-button-1 double clicks.  This allows you, for example, to
single-click on any Desktop object with button 3 to have the object opened.

<P><LI>If <B>"No conversion"</B> is selected, then MB3 click actions are
disabled. No translation occurs for MB3 clicks, so applications that define
a specific action for MB3 clicks will recognize them.

<P><LI>If <B>"Push to bottom"</B> is selected, then all MB3 clicks
over a window will push that window to the bottom of the Z-order stack.
This can be handy if your Desktop is crowded.

</UL>Note that MB3 clicks are only converted if the mouse is not moved
while mouse button 3 is held down.
