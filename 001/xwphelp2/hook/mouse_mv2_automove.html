        &xwp;: Auto-Move Mouse Pointer
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.14 -->
<BODY>

If <B>"Auto-move mouse pointer"</B> is enabled, &xwp; will automatically move
your mouse pointer to the default push button of windows when they appear
on the screen. This will only happen if the window actually does have a
default push button.

<P>With the <B>"Delay"</B> slider, you may determine the delay that &xwp;
will use in moving the pointer to such a push button.

<P>If the delay is set to 0, the mouse pointer is moved to the button immediately.

<P>If the delay is set to anything above 0, you will see the mouse pointer
wander over the screen into the direction of the button. This might make it
easier to spot where the mouse pointer is being moved to.

<P>If <B>"Animate"</B> is also enabled, &xwp; will display a little animation
over the button that the mouse pointer is being moved to while it is being
moved. This makes it even more obvious where the mouse pointer is moving to.
This will only work though if you have specified a delay above.

<!-- V1.0.8 -->
<P>If <B>"Center over buttonless dialogs"</B> is enabled, &xwp; will move the
mouse pointer to the center of any dialog which does not contain any push
button controls.
