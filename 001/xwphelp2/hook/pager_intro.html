PageMage is &xwp;'s virtual desktop manager.

<P>Essentially, it allows you to work on several desktops at once. Your physical
screen is considered one out of several virtual screens, and you can switch between
these. This effectively multiplies your working area since windows can reside outside
your currently visible desktop and still be switched to simply by switching to
another desktop.

<P>To configure PageMage, open the
<A HREF="objects/obj_screen.html">"Screen" settings object</A> in your "System setup"
folder, or select "Properties" from the PageMage context menu.
