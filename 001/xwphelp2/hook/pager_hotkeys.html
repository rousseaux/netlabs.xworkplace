If <B>"Arrow hotkeys switch desktops"</B> is checked, you can switch virtual desktops
using the arrow keys on your keyboard. You can specify the modifier keys which must be
held down in addition to the arrow keys. &xwp; does not allow you to disable all
the modifiers because this would prevent you from using the arrow keys in the normal
way. The default setting is to have Ctrl+Alt as the modifier keys.

<IFNDEF __NOXWPSETUP__>
<P>Note that the arrow hotkeys work even if you have disabled global hotkeys in the
<A HREF="objects/obj_xwpsetup.html">"&xwp; Setup" object</A>.
