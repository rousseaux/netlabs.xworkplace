If &pgr; mouse actions have been enabled on the
<A HREF="hook/pager1.html">first &pgr; page in the "Screen" notebook,</A>
the following actions are available
in the &pgr; window:

<UL><LI><B>Clicking with mouse button 1</B> on a mini-window in the &pgr;
window will bring the corresponding PM window to the foreground and switch
virtual desktops, if necessary.

<P><LI><B>Clicking with mouse button 2</B> will lower the corresponding window to the
background (i.e. make it the bottommost of all windows) and switch virtual desktops,
if necessary.

<P><LI>You can also <B>drag the mini windows with mouse button 2</B> within the
&pgr; window.
Once you release mouse button 2, the "real" window will be moved to the desired location.
This even allows you to move windows across several virtual desktops, which can come in
quite handy.

<!-- V0.9.18: added the following -->
<P>If you hold down the <B>Shift</B> key while dragging, the window will have the
exact same position on the target desktop as it had on the source desktop. In
other words, with the Shift key down, the window is dragged in units of full desktops,
not pixels.

<!-- V0.9.11: added the following -->
<P><LI><B>Clicking with mouse button 2</B> onto an empty area in the &pgr; window
will bring up the &pgr; &popmenu;.
