<BODY>
If <B>"Auto-hide mouse pointer"</B> is enabled, &xwp; will automatically hide
your mouse pointer from the screen if it hasn't been moved for the specified
number of seconds.
This might be helpful when reading text on the screen where the mouse pointer
frequently gets into the way.

<!-- the following three paragraphs are new.  V0.9.14 (2001-08-02) [lafaix] -->
<P>If <B>"Do not hide if a menu is open"</B> is also checked, the mouse
pointer will not be hidden if a menu is currently open.

<P>If <B>"Do not hide if over a push button"</B> is checked, the mouse
pointer will not be hidden while over a push button.

<P>Those two options might help you to locate the mouse pointer in places
where clicking could be harmful.
