The <B>"Virtual desktops"</B> area shows your current virtual desktops
layout.

<P>You can determine the <B>number of virtual desktops</B> that are in
use by moving the sliders to the top and to the left of the area.
For example, the default setup of 3x2 gives you a total of six virtual
desktops.

<P>In the middle of the display, the <B>startup desktop</B> is highlited.
That desktop is used when &pgr; is initialized during system startup.
You can change the startup desktop by double-clicking on one of the
desktop representations. The default startup desktop is at the bottom-left
corner.
