The <B>"Enable"</B> checkbox determines whether &xwp; allows you to use
virtual desktops at all.

<P>If the box is checked, the rest of the page (and the following pages)
are activated, and the &pgr; window appears on your screen. You can
then switch between multiple desktops, as described in the
<A HREF="hook/pager_intro.html">&pgr; introduction</A>.

<P>If the box is unchecked, &pgr; is deactivated, and all windows that
might currently reside on other desktops are brought back to your screen.
You then only have one desktop again.
