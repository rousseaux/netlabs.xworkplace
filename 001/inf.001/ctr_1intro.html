<!-- This is all new with V0.9.7. -->
<BODY>
Starting with V0.9.7, XWorkplace contains a replacement to OS/2 Warp 4's WarpCenter.
This is called the "XCenter".

<P>Technically, this is not a WarpCenter replacement... it does not replace the
"SmartCenter" WPS class, since that class is completely undocumented in the first place.
Instead, the XCenter is a new implementation from scratch. It is not compatible with
the WarpCenter and does not take over its settings, but it can do pretty much the same...
and more.

<P>Compared to the WarpCenter, the XCenter offers you the following advantages:

<UL><LI>It is <B>fully configurable.</B> You can add items to the XCenter at your free will,
while the WarpCenter will always contain fixed items at fixed locations.

<P>The items in the XCenter are called "widgets". You can add widgets to the XCenter
in any order.

<P>See <A HREF="ctr_2addwgt.html">"Adding and removing widgets"</A> for details.

<P><LI>You can have <B>more than one XCenter</B> on your system. Each XCenter stores its
widgets and their settings separately so that they will never conflict.

<P><LI>The XCenter offers you <B>more display styles</B> than the WarpCenter. You can drag
and drop fonts and colors onto the widgets, which will retain these settings
individually. Besides, the XCenter has an "auto-hide" option so that it will reduce
itself to a tiny bar at the bottom of the screen, similar to the task bar on
Windows 95. You can set those display options in the XCenter's settings notebook.

<P><LI>The XCenter supports <B>plug-in DLLs.</B> Any programmer can add new widget types
to the XCenter by writing a DLL and put it into the <CODE>plugins\xcenter</CODE>
directory of the XWorkplace installation directory.

<P>See <A HREF="ctr_9plugin.html">"About plug-in DLLs"</A> for details.

<P><LI>The XCenter runs on a <B>separate thread</B> within the WPS and can thus run with
a higher priority than other programs. You can set the priority in the XCenter's
settings notebook.

<P>While this cannot fix the PM single input queue (SIQ) problems, this can still
give you access to the XCenter if some program uses up all CPU time. For example,
I have found that Netscape tends to do this at times.
