<B>&xwp; 0.9.6 (November 25, 2000)</B>

<P>New features:
<UL><LI>Added QUICKOPEN=IMMEDIATE
<A HREF="xices_30wpsstrings.html">setup string</A> for folders.
<P><LI>Added new <A HREF="0632intro_statbars.html">status bar codes</A>
for automatic unit selection depending on the size of the data displayed.
Thanks, Paul Ratcliffe.
<P><LI><A HREF="file_1extassocs.html">Extended file associations</A>
should pretty much work now as designed. I had to recreate the entire "start program"
mechanism in the WPS to get this to work since IBM didn't care to export that.
Besides I reworked the internal association mechanisms to use less memory now.
Still, all this is a bit slower...
<P><LI>XWPString confirmations and drag'n'drop work now, even with multiple objects.
<P><LI>Added logo page to XWPSetup.
<P><LI>"File types" page in "Workplace Shell" is resizeable now as well.
<P><LI>Added method tokens to method tables in "WPS Class List" object, if
anybody cares.
<P><LI>Added program data to "Object" page.
<P><LI>Added "conditional cascade sensitivity" to sliding menus in "Mouse movement"
settings ("Mouse" object). Thanks, Paul Ratcliffe.
<P><LI>Added more WPS class descriptions.

</UL>Miscellaneous changes:
<UL><LI>Reworked the internal string routines to use less heap allocations.
This might make a few functions, including status bars, faster.
<P><LI>Added description of "Sliding menus" to User Guide, which was missing.

</UL>Bugfixes:
<UL><LI>&xwp; tended to create lots of invisible menu windows which were never
destroyed. Fixed that all over the place, thus reducing the pressure on PM.
<P><LI>Some private PM messages had duplicate values. Fixed.
<P><LI>Fixed a couple of minor memory leaks.
<P><LI>"Refresh now" from main menu messed up icon positions. Fixed.
<P><LI>Fixed a refresh problems with status bars. Also, the total object count should
now always be correct. Fixed by Paul Ratcliffe.
<P><LI>Greatly reduced memory consumption of the trash can when deleting large
folder trees. This should also put much less stress on the internal Desktop object management
and greatly speed up deleting.
<P><LI>Trash can didn't respect number settings from "Country" object. Fixed.
<P><LI>"Orphaned classes" in "WPS Class List" had "Create object" item. That didn't
make too much sense. Fixed by Paul Ratcliffe.
<P><LI>Fixed a minor description parsing problem in "WPS Class List".
<P><LI>Added "Refresh now" to "WPS Class List". Thanks, John Small.
<P><LI>Fixed close behavior of "Import WPS filters" dialog on extended "File types" page
in "Workplace Shell".
<P><LI>"Sound" object should work now even if MMPM/2 is installed on a drive other
than the boot drive.
<P><LI>"Sliding menus" sometimes did not un-hilite items properly, and submenus
sometimes opened more than they should.
Fixed by Paul Ratcliffe.
<P><LI>Object hotkeys stopped working after lockup. Fixed by Paul Ratcliffe.
<P><LI>Fixed WPS desktop dragging with PageMage.
<P><LI>On startup, PageMage now always selects the upper left desktop correctly.
<P><LI>"Close VIO" confirmation dialog during &xshutdown; had wrong help panel. Fixed.
<P><LI>V0.9.5's &xshutdown; got stuck closing &warpcenter;. Fixed.
