        Additional Disk Object Codes

</HEAD>
<!-- This file is all new with V0.84 and contains the status bar codes
     previously described in fldr_32statusbars.html. Nothing else has changed. -->
<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: see notes below -->
<BODY>
<!-- V0.9.0: add the following line -->
<B>Class: XFolder</B><HR>
<B>Disk objects</B> (WPDisk class, i.e. the objects in the "Drives" folder)
support the following codes <I>in addition</I> to the codes for all objects:
<BR><DL>
<DT><CITE>  $fb     </CITE><DD>free space on drive in bytes
<DT><CITE>  $fk     </CITE><DD>free space on drive in kBytes, i.e. bytes / 1000
<DT><CITE>  $fK     </CITE><DD>free space on drive in KBytes, i.e. bytes / 1024
<DT><CITE>  $fm     </CITE><DD>free space on drive in mBytes, i.e. bytes / 1000000
<DT><CITE>  $fM     </CITE><DD>free space on drive in MBytes, i.e. bytes / 1048576
<!-- V0.9.6: added the following two -->
<DT><CITE>  $fa     </CITE><DD>free space on drive in bytes/kBytes/mBytes/gBytes
(new with V0.9.6); this automatically chooses an optimal scale depending on the number
<DT><CITE>  $fA     </CITE><DD>free space on drive in bytes/KBytes/MBytes/GBytes
(new with V0.9.6); this automatically chooses an optimal scale depending on the number
<BR><DT><CITE>  $F      </CITE><DD>file-system type (FAT, HPFS, CDFS, ...)
</DL>
<BR><B>Notes:</B> If you are using these keys, you should make sure that you have
OS/2's hardware error messages disabled, because otherwise you'll get a
"drive not ready" message every time no disk is inserted.
The new <A HREF="sys_1intro.html">"OS/2 Kernel"</A>
object lets you do this on the "Errors" page.
<P>Note also that the <CITE>$f</CITE> codes are redefined for disk objects. Normally,
they display the free space on the drive on which the <I>folder</I> resides, which, for
the "Drives" folder, would of course always return the same value for the drive on
which your Desktop resides. Thus this code has been redefined for drive objects.
