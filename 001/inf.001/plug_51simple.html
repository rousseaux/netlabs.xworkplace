<BODY>
XWorkplace now comes with a mini-widget sample (<CODE>toolkit\miniwdgt.c</CODE>)
which contains an absolute minimum widget without any fancy functionality.
All this widget does is display a question mark.

<P>This mini widget was added to show you something to start with. It can definitely
be improved. It does <I>not</I>

<UL><LI>store any settings (not even font or color presentation parameters --
see <A HREF="plug_52strings.html">step 2</A> for this);

<P><LI>display tooltips (fly-over help -- see <A HREF="plug_53tooltips.html">step 3</A>
for this);

<P><LI>implement a settings dialog (see <A HREF="plug_55dialog.html">step 4</A> for this);

</UL>At the very least, a plug-in DLL must do the following:

<OL><LI>It must contain a <B>PM window procedure</B> for the widget class.
In the mini widget sample, this is the
<CODE>fnwpSampleWidget</CODE> procedure.

<P>This is the usual switch/case stuff that is used with every PM
window procedure. There are a couple of extra considerations to be
made though, which are explained below.

<P><LI>On <CODE>WM_CREATE</CODE>, the widget <I>must</I> store the
<A HREF="plug_9xcenterwidget.html"><CODE>XCENTERWIDGET</CODE></A>
pointer it receives with <CODE>mp1</CODE> in
its <CODE>QWL_USER</CODE> window word. That's why the mini widget sample
calls <CODE>WinSetWindowPtr(hwnd, QWL_USER, mp1);</CODE> on WM_CREATE.

<P><LI>On <CODE>WM_CONTROL</CODE>, it should handle notifications from
the XCenter. The XCenter will send <CODE>WM_CONTROL</CODE> messages to
the widget when it wants to know the widget's size, for example.

<P><LI>Normally, with PM, all unprocessed messages are forwarded to
<CODE>WinDefWindowProc</CODE>. With widgets, this is different: you must
always pass unprocessed messages to the "XCenter default widget procedure",
whose address is given to your widget in the
<A HREF="plug_9xcenterwidget.html"><CODE>XCENTERWIDGET</CODE></A>
structure on <CODE>WM_CREATE</CODE> in the <CODE>pfnwpDefWidgetProc</CODE>
field. (Yes, this is the reason why you must
store that structure in your window word.)

<P>If you do not pass unused messages on, you will severely hurt the widget's
functionality. Even worse, you will cause memory leaks because the default
widget procedure is responsible for cleaning up resources.

<P><LI>Even if you do your own processing on <CODE>WM_DESTROY</CODE>, you
must <I>always, always</I> pass <CODE>WM_DESTROY</CODE> on to
<CODE>pfnwpDefWidgetProc</CODE>. Otherwise the XCenter cannot clean up your
widget's resources properly.

<P><LI>Your widget plug-in DLL must <B>export two procedures</B> by ordinal.

<P>The <B>"init"</B> export (ordinal 1) gets called once only by the XCenter
when your DLL gets loaded. The DLL can get loaded in situations other than
widget creation, so do not expect this to always be the case. On init, the
DLL should register the widget's PM window class (by calling
<CODE>WinRegisterClass</CODE>). In addition, it can import functions from
<CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE>, whose module handle is given to it (this is optional).
However, it must always return a pointer to the array of <CODE>XCENTERWIDGETCLASS</CODE>
structures in the DLL so that the XCenter knows about the classes in the DLL.

<P>See <CODE>toolkit\miniwdgt.c</CODE> for how this is done.

<P>The <B>"uninit"</B> export (ordinal 2) gets called when the DLL is unloaded
by the XCenter. This can do cleanup, if necessary.
