<B>&xwp; 0.9.11 (April 26, 2001)</B>

<P>New features:
<UL><LI>The PageMage window can now be dragged itself if the drag starts on an
empty space in the pager itself.
<P><LI>Added PageMage context menu.
<P><LI>Added new <A HREF="0632intro_statbars.html">status bar codes:</A>
$zb etc. for total disk size, $L for disk label.
<P><LI>Really added diskfree widget to the distribution this time.
<P><LI>Made Health widget a separate package in the distribution.
<P><LI>Widgets can now be deleted from "Widgets" page in &xcenter; settings notebook.
Properties dialogs can be opened from there too, but this has not been extensively
tested yet.

</UL>Miscellaneous changes:
<UL><LI>Christian Langanke added 16x16 resolutions to the default replacement icons.
<P><LI>Optimized the status bar text composition routines for speed.
<P><LI>Rewrote large parts of the window list widget. This now displays the buttons
in the proper order (new windows appear to the right). Besides, restoring to maximized
should now work for all session types.
<P><LI>Added termination exception handler to XWPDAEMN.EXE for proper hook cleanup,
should the daemon get killed for any reason.
<P><LI>Changed default widget menu item IDs to above 0x7f00 to avoid conflicts with
WPS menu item IDs. I hope this won't break any existing widgets.

</UL>Bugfixes:
<UL><LI>Config.sys routines never found lines that had leading spaces. Fixed.
<P><LI>Added an extra check for floppies in the routines that checked for whether
a drive is ready. Maybe this fixes hangs with non-DOS disks.
<P><LI>Removed useless shadow populate for internal "populate folders only" call,
which was used from, among other places, the trash can routines.
<P><LI>Toggling the folder status bar state via the "View" context menu rarely
saved the change. Fixed.
<P><LI>Removed a number of useless settings pages for DLL and driver files.
<P><LI>Opening objects from the &xcenter; made them run on the &xcenter; thread, which
caused a forced close when the &xcenter; thread terminated (because the &xcenter; was
closed). Fixed; now routing all open requests to thread 1.
<P><LI>&xcenter; "Run" command couldn't handle parameters and fully qualified
executables. Fixed.
<P><LI>&xcenter; "Run" entry fields were limited to 30 some characters. Fixed.
<P><LI>Standard widget menu items ("Remove", "Help") never worked for object button
widgets. Fixed.
<P><LI>"Immediate hilite" handling for sliding menus was completely rewritten.
Works much better now.
<P><LI>Killing XWPDAEMN.EXE would only work about a dozen times before hanging the
system for good. Added thread-granular termination handling now, which should
properly clean up now (still looks like a PM bug for me).
<P><LI>PageMage "Sticky" page in "Screen" object listed invisible switchlist entries.
Fixed, only listing visible ones now.
<P><LI>New &xshutdown; save-object routines from V0.9.8 attempted to save objects
which no longer existed, which could hang shutdown in certain situations. Fixed.
<P><LI>&xshutdown; hung the system if print jobs were still pending. Fixed; &xshutdown;
will now simply tell the user to remove those first.
