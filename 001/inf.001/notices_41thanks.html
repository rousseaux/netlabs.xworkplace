<BODY>
Well, there are a lot of people to thank. XWorkplace is still a fairly young piece
of software, but still so many people have sent in remarks and supported me.
You are too many to be mentioned here separately.
If you don't find your name in this list, please feel addressed
with this global thank you! Without all this support, XWorkplace wouldn't be
where it is today.

<P>XWorkplace is free software. Some people have paid me in naturals anyways:

<UL><LI>Glauco Ippolitoni, Italy, for the Win95 keyboard
