<BODY>
Well, there are a lot of people to thank... &xwp; is still a fairly young piece
of software, but still so many people have sent in remarks and supported me.
You are too many to be mentioned here separately.
If you don't find your name in this list, please feel addressed
with this global thank you! Without all this support, &xwp; wouldn't be
where it is today.

<P>The following people deserve a big thank you for contributing to &xwp;:
