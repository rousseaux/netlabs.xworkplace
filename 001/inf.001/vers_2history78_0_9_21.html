As a general change, this release will most probably no longer run on Warp 3
since I am overriding quite a number of WPS methods now that are specific
to OS/2 Warp 4. I was getting tired of hacking around menu specifics for
Warp 4 and am now using Warp 4's interfaces for that.

<P>I have gotten no reports about Warp 3 recently so I assume this will not
break &xwp; for a lot of people. To those who are still running Warp 3, I am
sorry, but Warp 4 is six years old by now as well and it should be possible
to get it cheap somewhere. Otherwise, stick with &xwp; V0.9.20.

<P><B>&xwp; 0.9.21 (August 11, 2002)</B>

<P>New features:

<UL><LI>Common: Added "Report bug" button to &xwp; product info dialog.
<b>Please use that button for all bug reports from now on.</b> Thank you.

<P><LI>Startup: &xwp; is now checking the WPS's class replacements list on
startup to make sure that XFldObject is the first replacement of WPObject.
This should fix the problems with the "Speech" tab missing when VoiceType
is installed, hopefully.

<P><LI>Folder split views. Select "Split view" from a folder's "open" menu.

<P><LI>OS/2 Kernel, program files: bldlevel parser can now handle the weird format that
is used by IBM TCP/IP.

<P><LI>Disks: Fixed a bunch of weirdos in the WPS disk context menus. For one, the
IBM peer class replacements kept showing the "drive not ready" hard error TWICE
when requesting the context menu for a drive with no media. Secondly, the WPS
seemed to be using the system uptime to determine whether "Lock" and "Eject"
should be shown for removeable disks. "Lock" and "Eject" are now always shown.
Both features are only
enabled when the "Replace drive not ready" feature is enabled, for security.

<P><LI>&pgr;: Martin Lafaix added "Sticky" menu option to system menus.

</UL>Miscellaneous changes:

<UL><LI>Common: Rewrote large parts of the dialog formatter to allow for easier handling
of nested subtables in dialog descriptions.

<P><LI>Common: Me smartass finally figured out that declaring functions as "static"
will never put them into the linker's map files. As a result, they didn't end up
the SYM files either, which made &xwp;'s trap logs a lot less informative. Fixed,
I removed all "static" declarations for now.

<P><LI>Folder menus: Rewrote and adjusted large parts of the internal menu hacks
to get split views to work. I hope this hasn't broken anything for the default
(icon, tree, details) folder views.

<P><LI>Folder hotkeys: Martin Lafaix rewrote the respective page in "Workplace Shell".

</UL>Bugfixes:

<UL><LI>Common: Executable header parser was completely broken for files without extensions
(e.g. OS2KRNL). Fixed; "Module" page now displays correctly.

<P><LI>Common: &xwp; kept the default OS/2 shutdown from finishing, at least with IBM MCP2.
Fixed.

<P><LI>Common: Changed a shared function that requested the object mutex too frequently
and made it use a private mutex instead. That fixed several situations where the WPS
deadlocked because of mutexes requested in reverse order by two different threads.
Among others, this fixes the hangs during installation (instl001.cmd) on SMP and
when dragging attachments from PMMail to the Desktop.

<P><LI>Folders: "Create new" from template in config folder never worked really well
in Tree views. Fixed a few things.

<P><LI>Folders: Status bars produced vertical scroll bars for all folders that
had "always sort" off. Fixed.

<P><LI>Folder hotkeys: Disabled select by name, select all, and deselect all for
Tree views finally.

<P><LI>Folder sort: Settings were quite broken for newly created folders sometimes.
Fixed.

<P><LI>Select by name, Batch rename: Always popped up twice when invoked from a
context menu. Fixed; added folder title to dialog title while I was at it.

<P><LI>Startup and Shutdown folders: Folder titles were never localized. Fixed.

<P><LI>Folder painting: "shadow icons" produced strange display for shadowed folders
in Tree view. Fixed.

<P><LI>Extended associations: "Export" facility did not escape attribute values like &amp;
properly. Fixed.

<P><LI>Extended associations: After setting the icon of a data file object,
changing its title would replace the custom icon with that of the associated
program. Fixed.

<P><LI>File operations: If deletion of a data file failed, e.g. because it was
currently used, the WPS object was removed anyway without an error message. Fixed,
added meaningful error messages also.

<P><LI>Programs: Knut St. Osmundsen fixed some problems with passing environments
on program startup.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Mostly rewrote pulse widget graph painting to fix the vertical lines
on the left if a high load was displayed. Optimized the code at the same time to save
a few hundered Gpi* calls.

<P><LI>WPS class list: crashed when selecting an orphaned WPS class. Bug was introduced
with 0.9.20, fixed.

<P><LI>OS/2 Kernel, program files: bldlevel display missed single-character substrings in
extended bldlevel format (e.g. DANIS506.ADD). Fixed.

<P><LI>Hook: Martin Lafaix fixed a few weirdos with auto-hide mouse.

<P><LI>Netscape DDE: finally passes URLs with ? characters correctly.
