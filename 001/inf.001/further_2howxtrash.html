        How Does the Trash Can Work?
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<!-- this is all new with V0.9.0 -->
<BODY>
Even though the trash can looks like a normal folder, it behaves quite differently
internally.
<UL><LI>When an <B>object is deleted</B> into the trash can (either by dropping it onto
the trash can or by selecting "Delete" from the object's context menu), it is <I>not</I>
physically moved into the trash can folder (which, being a folder, is a regular
directory on the disk).
<P>Instead, the following happens:
<BR><OL><LI>The trash can then creates an invisible directory in the root directory
of the drive where the object resides. This directory is always called <CODE>\TRASH</CODE>.
(You can see it by typing <CODE>DIR /A \</CODE> on the command line.)
<P><LI>The trash can then creates a subpath in that hidden directory according to the
path where the object currently resides. That is, for example, if the object is in the
folder <CODE>D:\MYFILES\ARTICLES</CODE>, the directory <CODE>D:\TRASH\MYFILES\ARTICLES</CODE>
is created. This allows the trash can to remember where the object was deleted from.
<P><LI>The object is then moved into <I>that</I> directory (and not the actual trash can
folder).
<!-- V0.9.5: changed the following paragraph -->
<P>The reason for this is simple: speed. If we were physically moving objects into the
trash can folder, this would frequently move files across drives. (Just think about
moving a 30 MB file into the trash can this way.) By contrast, since the
<CODE>\TRASH</CODE> directory is always on the same drive as the object, even moving
large folder trees should take place very fast.
<P><LI>In order to still make the object visible in the trash can itself, an instance
of XWPTrashObject is created in the trash can. This class is a subclass of WPTransient,
which means that it is not persistent between WPS restarts, but only while the WPS is
running. As a result, these "trash objects" do not consume any space in OS2.INI.
<!-- V0.9.5: added the following paragraph -->
<P>So when an object is moved to the trash can, it is actually duplicated: the "real"
object is moved to the invisible <CODE>\TRASH</CODE> directory tree, and a "trash object"
(XFldTrashObject, WPTransient subclass) is created in the trash can.

</OL>
<BR><LI>When the <B>trash can is opened</B> (and thus populated), all drives are scanned for
the hidden <CODE>\TRASH</CODE> directories, and trash objects are created according to the
objects which reside in the subdirectories in there.
<P><LI>When an <B>object is restored</B> (or moved out of the trash can), the corresponding
"real" object in the <CODE>\TRASH</CODE> directories is moved back to where it was
deleted from (or to the location where the user is moving it to), and the trash object
in the trash can is destroyed, since it serves no longer any purpose.
<P><LI>When an <B>object is destroyed</B> (or the trash can is emptied altogether), all
objects in the <CODE>\TRASH</CODE> directories are destroyed, and all trash objects
in the trash can are destroyed also.
</UL>
This approach seemed like a good compromise for speed and stability, while not messing
with the WPS internals too much. I had initially thought about using a subclass of
<!-- V0.9.5: changed all the following -->
WPAbstract for the trash can, but this would create lots of entries in OS2.INI with
the usual problems associated with that.

<P>Besides, using a subclass of WPTransient has another advantage. Since the
trash objects (the transient objects) are recreated from scratch after every WPS
restart, if something goes wrong really bad, you can manually delete all the hidden
<CODE>\TRASH</CODE> directories on all drives, and after the next WPS startup, the
trash can is completely empty.
