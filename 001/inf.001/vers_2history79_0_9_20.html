<B>&xwp; 0.9.20 (July 2, 2002)</B>

<P>New features:

<UL><LI>Documented XWPString setup strings. Added NOSTRINGPAGE setup string.

</UL>Miscellaneous changes:

<UL><LI>

</UL>Bugfixes:

<UL><LI>Install: Fixed several problems with installation objects.

<P><LI>Common: Replaced all strchr and strrchr calls in XWorkplace with a DBCS-enabled
version, of which I do not know whether it actually works. I'd be grateful if Asian
testers could check whether the bugs that have been reported are fixed by this since,
again, I have no way of testing DBCS here.

<P><LI>Program objects: Command line icons were broken (in "Command Prompts" folder),
and batch files and Win-OS/2 full screen objects didn't work at all. Fixed.

<P><LI>Folders: "Batch rename" dialog had problems enabling the start rename button.
Fixed.

<P><LI>Sound object: Sound scheme testing was case-sensitive, while sound schemes
in OS2SYS.INI are case-insensitive. Fixed.

<P><LI>Screen object: Special functions on screen border objects page had funny
titles, fixed.

<P><LI>&pgr;: Removed silly "Pager is disabled" message from "Add sticky window"
dialog.

<P><LI>&pgr;: Stay on top would never work, fixed.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Diskfree (WarpCenter style) would never save its width, fixed.
