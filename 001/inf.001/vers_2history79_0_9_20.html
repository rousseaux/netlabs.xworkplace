<P>New features:

</UL>Miscellaneous changes:

<UL><LI>

</UL>Bugfixes:

<UL><LI>Common: Replaced all strchr and strrchr calls in XWorkplace with a DBCS-enabled
version, of which I do not know whether it actually works. I'd be grateful if Asian
testers could check whether the bugs that have been reported are fixed by this since,
again, I have no way of testing DBCS here.

<P><LI>Program objects: Command line icons were broken (in "Command Prompts" folder),
and Win-OS/2 full screen object didn't work at all. Fixed.

<P><LI>Sound object: Sound scheme testing was case-sensitive, while sound schemes
in OS2SYS.INI are case-insensitive. Fixed.
