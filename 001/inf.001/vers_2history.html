<H6>"A designer knows he has arrived at
perfection not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there
is no longer anything to take away."
<P>Antoine de Saint-Exupery</H6>

This page lists the revision history of XWorkplace (since V0.9.0 was released).
The history of the previous XFolder packages are on a <A HREF="vers_2history2.html">separate page</A>.

<P><B>XWorkplace 0.9.2 (March 5, 2000)</B>
<H6>New features:
<UL><LI>Incorporated "PageMage", virtual desktops.
<P><LI>Automatic menu selection, even with configurable delay for submenus (as in Win95).
Added second "Movement" page to "Mouse" object for this.
<P><LI>New "Screen" settings object, which has those "System" settings pages dealing
with the screen. The "Screen" page from "OS/2 Kernel" has been moved to that object now.
<P><LI>Trash can now automatically calculates the total size if a folder has been deleted,
including subdirectories.
<P><LI>Added meaningful file operations error messages. Drives support is finally
respected for deleting objects to the trash can.
<P><LI>XSHUTDWN.EXE has been added again. Seems to work.
<P><LI>Added "delay" setting for APM power off to "XShutdown" page.

</UL>Miscellaneous changes:
<UL><LI>"Shutdown" menu item now has the "d" shortcut, which doesn't conflict with
"Properties".
<P><LI>Further optimized hook logic for speed.
<P><LI>Changed all XWorkplace object IDs to start with &lt;XWP_xxx&gt; to avoid conflicts
with old XFolder versions.
<P><LI>The configuration folder is no longer automatically created at startup because
this lead to problems on some systems. Use the "Objects" page in "XWorkplace setup"
to create it manually.
<P><LI>Updated the "XWorkplace" sub-config folder a bit.
<P><LI>XWorkplace settings objects had a "Create another" menu item, which doesn't make
sense. Removed that.
<P><LI>Rearranged controls on "File" page a bit.
<P><LI>Increased stack space for all additional XWorkplace threads.
<P><LI>Removed context-sensitive help upon pressing F1 on some notebook pages.
Now we'll always show the help for the entire page first.

</UL>Bugfixes:
<UL><LI>The "Auto-hide mouse pointer" checkbox on the "Mouse movement" page wasn't
working. Another (static) control on the page had the same dialog item ID. %$õ%!, I hate
that. Took me half an hour to figure out.
<P><LI>Mouse-button-3 scrolling didn't work horizontally when vertical scroll bar was disabled in a window. Fixed.
<P><LI>Fixed some other minor quirks with MB3 scrolling.
<P><LI>Many hook features were triggered even though the mouse was currently captured by an application
or the system. This could lead to severe system hangs, especially with "show window list everywhere".
Fixed.
<P><LI>"Hot corners" desktop menu sometimes conflicted with "sliding focus" because
the focus was immediately given back to the window under the mouse. Fixed.
<P><LI>"Archive" status window was displayed even if this was turned off. Fixed.
<P><LI>"Subject" field on first "File" page was limited to 36 characters. Changed this
to 260, even though the IBM docs say this isn't so. Thanks, Mike Reichel, for counting
the characters.
<P><LI>Added thread-safety checks to internal folder contents enumerations.
<P><LI>With folders, "Object" page would appear between the two "Icon" pages. Fixed.
<P><LI>Using work area folders would lock the WPS hard when objects in the folder were
re-opened. Fixed.
<P><LI>Deleting the configuration folder would take to a lot of WPS-internal crashes
the next time a folder context menu was opened. Fixed.
<P><LI>Drives were checked for readiness even if "Replace drive not ready dlg" was
disabled. Fixed. If a drive cannot be opened now, disable that setting.
<P><LI>There was a heap allocation error with the XWPSetup object on object creation,
sometimes leading to system hangs. Fixed.
<P><LI>XFldDisk and XFldShutdown items were checked in the "XWorkplace classes" dlg
even if those classes were not installed. Fixed.
<P><LI>Automatically creating the trashcan via "Features" works now.
<P><LI>The trash can now displays the "File exists" dialog correctly when a file exists
in the trash can already.
<P><LI>Converting settings from XFolder led to some problems. Fixed.
<P><LI>Menu buttons (e.g. the "Partitions" button) displayed a menu even if disabled. Fixed.
<P><LI>The bitmap which was created with the "Details" chart was never freed (baaaad
PM resource leak). Fixed.

</UL></H6><P><B>XWorkplace 0.9.1 (February 18, 2000)</B>
<H6>First XWorkplace public release.
New features:

<UL><LI>Added object setup string decoding to the "Object" page of every object's
settings notebook.
<P><LI>Added container view flags to "Object" page details.
<P><LI>New hook features on "Mouse mappings" page 2:
mouse-button-3 scrolling, auto-hide mouse pointers, and more.
<P><LI>Added "Show Desktop's context menu" to special functions with screen corner objects.
<P><LI>Added "Enable NumLock on Startup" feature.
<P><LI>Added "Drives" page to trash can's settings notebook for individual
drives support.
<P><LI>Added second "File" page to file-system objects to display all extended attributes.
<P><LI>"WPS Class List" is now multithreaded to some extent.
<P><LI>Trash can "delete" support is finally working! Full drag'n'drop support also.
<P><LI>Implemented proper trash can drives support.
<P><LI>Created generic file operations framework which can process file operations
on the File thread (in order not to block the user interface). This is now used for
"move to trash can", "restore from trash can", "destroy trash objects",
"empty trash can" -- all multithreaded and with progress bars.
<P><LI>"Cannot close VIO window" dialog in XShutdown has been reworked to store
the selection with the auto-close items list while XShutdown is running.
<P><LI>Treesize displays the number of files per directory and can sort according to that now too.
<P><LI>NetscDDE is now prepared for National Language Support too.
<P><LI>Added some SOM kernel classes to "WPS Class List" descriptions.

</UL>Miscellaneous changes:
<UL><LI>Updated messages for the XFLDTRAP.LOG exception log file.
<P><LI>Folder content menus are finally limited so that the menu is not
built for several thousand files.
<P><LI>System sounds are now automatically installed when the respective flag
on the XWPSetup "Features" page is checked.
<P><LI>Added NLS to various parts of XWorkplace where it was missing.
<P><LI>Reorganized WPS Class List code again.
<P><LI>Took the time to work on exception handling once more. Made the entire mechanism
more bomb-proof.

</UL>Bugfixes:

<UL><LI>After closing a subdialog of a notebook page, the WPS would sometimes hang.
Now all subdialogs are owned by the frame instead of the page, which should fix this,
even though I still don't understand what's going here.
<P><LI>Replaced all DosRequestMutexSem calls with WinRequestMutexSem calls.
<P><LI>"Open parent" (Backspace) would crash the WPS when used in a drive (root folder)
window. Fixed.
<P><LI>"Open parent and close" (Shift+Backspace per default) invoked on the Desktop
would close the Desktop. Not such a good idea. Fixed.
<P><LI>"Select by name" was added for Tree views also, which didn't make sense. Fixed.
<P><LI>WinDestroyWindow was never called on "Select by name" windows. Fixed.
<P><LI>Status bars were added to folders even though the feature was disabled
in "Workplace Shell". Fixed.
<P><LI>Right-clicking on a status bar would produce the folder's context menu, but when
changing to a different submenu, the main menu would disappear and the new submenu would
appear just anywhere on the screen. I finally figured out how to call wpDisplayMenu
correctly, so this is fixed now.
<P><LI>Forgot "Work area" setting on "File" page with folders. Fixed.
<P><LI>Fixed a number of small memory leaks with shaped windows, notebook page management,
progress bars, WPS class list, split window controls, "OS/2 Kernel" object.
<P><LI>Sometimes invoking settings strings on folders (esp. "ALWAYSSORT") would work
initially, but not be saved to the extended attributes of the folder. Fixed. Er, this must
have been in XFolder forever.
<P><LI>Replacement "File exists" dialog would sometimes hang the WPS if a large number
of files was processed. Fixed; now using folder mutex semaphores for thread safety.
<P><LI>Trash can kept crashing the WPS in some background thread a few seconds after
the last trash object was destroyed. This happened because the WPS unloaded the
XWPTrashObject class if no more objects of that class existed. Fixed, but that one was
tricky.
<P><LI>Trash objects had "Create another" menu item, which doesn't make sense. Removed.
<P><LI>Fixed trash can populate/refresh mechanism. This is now faster and doesn't crash
all the time (famous last words).
<P><LI>Fixed heap errors with text message file (TMF) handling, which caused sporadic,
non-reproduceable crashes. Also, the TMF got recompiled every single time; fixed that
also.
<P><LI>Loading and unloading the XWorkplace hook via XWPSetup didn't work.
Fixed hookInit and hookKill (xwphook.c).
<P><LI>Fixed XShutdown thread synchronization problems introduced with V0.9.0.
<P><LI>The new XShutdown confirmation introduced with V0.9.0 wasn't always working right. Fixed.

</UL></H6><B>XWorkplace 0.9.0 (November 28, 1999)</B>
<H6>Obviously, I've renamed the whole thing. This version was never released
as a binary version, but only uploaded in source to the Netlabs CVS server.

<P>New features (lots of major ones):
<UL><LI><A HREF="sys_1intro.html">"XWorkplace Setup" object</A> with more general settings.
<P><LI>Extended association mechanism.
<P><LI><A HREF="file_2trashcan.html">XWorkplace trash can.</A>
<P><LI>New <A HREF="06341intro_mousekey.html">XWorkplace PM hook</A> for mouse and keyboard
features (object hotkeys, sliding focus, screen corner objects).
<P><LI>The <A HREF="sys_4wpsclasses.html">"WPS Class List"</A> has been greatly enhanced.
This is now in a separate object, with a split view for a more lucid display.
We now have a new "Create object" context menu item for each installed class,
and method information can be displayed.
<P><LI>New "Sound" object replacement (by replacing the WPSound class).
This has much better sound selections now, with full sound scheme support, even on Warp 3.
<P><LI>"System paths" page in "OS/2 Kernel".
<P><LI>"Drivers" page in "OS/2 Kernel".
<P><LI>"File" pages in file-system object settings notebooks can be replaced
with a new, single page.
<P><LI>"Details" page in disk objects can also be replaced.
<P><LI>All-new "Module" page in program file settings objects, which retrieves
additional information from the executable direcly.
<P><LI><A HREF="menu_7selectsome.html">"Select by name" dialog</A>
now has a history of the last 10 file masks which were entered.
<P><LI>Status bars can now dereference shadows (new setting in "Workplace Shell").
<P><LI>New "Menu bar" setting in Warp 4's "View" context submenu.
<P><LI>New "XWorkplace panic" dialog when Shift key is held down during WPS startup,
which allows you to selectively disable XWorkplace features.
<P><LI>New "Startup" and "Shutdown" pages in Desktop's settings notebook. Startup
page allows you to configure the <A HREF="xsd_03bootlogo.html">boot logo</A> now.
There are now two boot logo styles,
for many people preferred the old blow-up style over the transparent boot logos.
<P><LI>XFldDesktop can now switch between several shutdown menu styles. Also,
"Sort" and "Arrange" can be disabled for the Desktop only.
<P><LI>New "Partitions" button in user-reboot items dialog to automatically add
BootManager partitions.
<P><LI>Per popular request, exception handler beeping can be disabled now
("XWorkplace Setup", "Paranoia" page).
<P><LI>Treesize: is now NLS enabled and dynamically updates the directory sizes even
while collecting files (instead of just displaying "working...").

</UL>Miscellaneous changes:
<UL><LI>I've finally found the time to rework all the functions in
the linklist.* files. This should speed up a number of internal
functions significantly.
<P><LI>The code for building folder context menus from the Configuration Folder
contents has been mostly rewritten. This now uses less memory and implements
a cache for the objects in the contents folder so that they need not be rebuilt
every time a context menu is opened, but only if the .ICONPOS EAs changed.
Lots of new function in menus.c for this.
<P><LI>Restructured settings pages all over the place.
<P><LI>Raised default "variable menu item ID offset" to 700 for
<A HREF="vers_1compat.html">Object Desktop compatibility</A>.
<P><LI>Included Christian Langanke's new TMF functions for message handling.
XWorkplace message files are now plain text; MKMSGF.EXE is no longer needed
to translate message files.
<P><LI>Removed the "default class title" for the XFolder class. Folder default
titles are no longer changed.
<P><LI>Improved multithreading all over the place. Introduced new "File" thread
with regular priority which takes over some functionality from the Worker thread.
<P><LI>Also, "Refresh now" now operates in the "File" thread (which blocked
the user interface previously).
<P><LI>"File exists" dialog now displays file sizes in bytes, not KB.
<P><LI>XShutdown now writes time information into the XSHUTDWN.LOG file with each
line.

</UL>Bugfixes:
<UL><LI>Fixed a minor problem when NLS strings were not found (cmnLoadString).
<P><LI>Fixed the ancient check box double-click bug. ;-) Double-clicks on
check boxes are no longer ignored (fnwpNotebookCommon, notebook.c).
<P><LI>Some users reported that the Configuration Folder was no longer found
with certain configurations when it was moved away from the location where the install
program creates it. Fixed; since the WPS method which has been defined for this doesn't
seem to be working with all Warp versions and fixpak levels (esp. not on Aurora), I
have written my own (wpshQueryObjectFromID).
<P><LI>When folder auto-sort was off but status bars enabled, folder contents
would keep scrolling up when opened in Icon view, adding ugly scroll bars to
the folder window even if not necessary. Fixed (now zeroing SUBCLASSEDLISTITEM
properly, cmnSubclassFolderFrame, common.c).
<P><LI>Folder content menus would sometimes crash with titles > 100 chars.
<P><LI>"View" pulldown in Warp 4 folder menu bars lacked the additional items.
I'm not sure if this was broken in V0.85 already or if I broke this since then,
but it's working now anyways. ;-)
<P><LI>Right-click on status bars opened the closed-view context menu (open-view
items were missing). Fixed (fnwpStatusBar, xfldr.c).
<P><LI>The "Select by name" dialog had problems finding files according to
wildcards like "*html" (without dots). Fixed (new function strhMatch, stringh.c).
<P><LI>The boot logo would remain on the screen forever if startup folder processing
was cancelled or errors occured during startup. Fixed.
<P><LI>Fixed a few small memory leaks (XFldObject "Object" settings page,
"Auto-close items" and "User reboot" dialogs).
<P><LI>For drives > 4 GB, XFolder still returned garbage status bar information.
Fixed, thanks to Rdiger Ihle who found the bug in the sources.
<P><LI>Error message 99 when opening a disk object had a "%1" string in there. Fixed;
this now displays the drive letter.
<P><LI>The WPS class list produced an exception every time a class was deregistered
using the context menus. Fixed; container record cores are now freed before the
corresponding data is freed.
<P><LI>Previous versions sometimes forgot to process the contents of the XWorkplace
startup folder upon first bootup. This has been completely reworked, now using the
XWorkplace daemon (XWPDAEMON.EXE).
<P><LI>XShutdown would crash when the INI file names were specified in lower case
in CONFIG.SYS. Fixed.
<P><LI>XShutdown sent WM_CLOSE to some applications instead of just WM_QUIT. For
example, Program Commander didn't like this too much. Fixed; all PM apps get
WM_QUIT now.
<P><LI>For some reason, XFldObject::wpObjectReady does not get called for WPFolder
instances (at least on my Warp 4 FP 10), so that the Worker thread was unable to
track awake folders.Fixed; we now override XFolder::wpObjectReady also.
<P><LI>Finally made the global and kernel settings thread-safe in really all possible
situations (hopefully). This fixes a number of problems with folder windows which
are not running on thread 1, which happens sometimes (e.g. folders opened from REXX
or TREESIZE.EXE).
<P><LI>Reworked exception handlers once again. This fixes hangs in the Worker thread
when PMSHELL.EXE got killed or trapped somewhere, which used to require a system reboot.
<P><LI>I have reorganized large portions of the XShutdown code, which should help
with some hung systems during XShutdown.
