<BODY>
Since XWorkplace now uses WarpIN for <A HREF="inst_1inst.html">installation</A>,
it now uses WarpIN for de-installation also. Either double-click on the WarpIN
program object and select the XWorkplace package(s) for de-installation, or
double-click on the XWorkplace archive again, both of which will de-install
XWorkplace.
<P>
If you wish to remove XWorkplace because you don't consider it to be of any use for you,
that's fine.
<P>
However, if you remove it because it does not seem to be working right or messes up your
system, please <A HREF="notices_3comments.html">contact me</A> so I can improve it.
