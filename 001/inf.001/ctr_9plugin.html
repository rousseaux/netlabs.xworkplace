<BODY>
The XCenter was designed to support plug-in DLLs. This allows programmers to add
new widget types (called "widget classes") to the XCenter without having to
actually modify XWorkplace itself.

<P>The existing <A HREF="ctr_3stdwgt.html">standard widget classes</A> are partly
built into <CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE> itself (if they make extensive use of WPS features,
such as with the object button widget), but some of them are already implemented as
plug-in DLLs. This was done for two reasons: first, to test that the plug-in
DLL interface actually works, and second, to give potential developers the chance
to look at how this can be done.

<P>As an example, let's say you are the developer of an e-mail program. You could write
a plug-in that periodically checks the user's mail server for new mail. If any is
found, that widget could start flashing, and if the user clicks on it, the e-mail
client would be started to retrieve the new mail.

<P>To implement plug-in DLLs, you need to download the
<A HREF="notices_40source.html">XWorkplace source code</A>.

<P>But don't get scared...
you do <I>not</I> need to compile XWorkplace or even understand WPS programming
to write a plug-in DLLs. If you know how to program in C and know a bit about
Presentation Manager (PM) programming, you can write a plug-in DLL.

<P>You can use any C compiler you want. Even EMX/GCC should do. You only need the
XWorkplace sources to be able to include the public XCenter headers for definitions
of how to communicate with the XCenter. In addition, in the XWorkplace sources, you
will find the source code for the standard plug-in DLLs which come with XWorkplace
(the window list and the clock and memory monitors), which show you how it's done.

<P>Basically, writing an XCenter plug-in DLL requires the following:

<OL><LI>You need to write a <B>PM window class.</B> In other words, write a PM
window procedure which responds to standard PM messages and register it when your
DLL gets loaded.

<P>Since widgets are really plain PM windows, your widget can do anything you want.
It has its own rectangle on the
XCenter bar and can display any data or graphics or whatever. Your widget runs in
the WPS process and can therefore even access all WPS interfaces, if you know SOM
programming (but again, this knowledge is not required -- unless you really want
to interface the WPS itself).

<P><LI>In addition to writing that PM window class, you will have to
<B>export two functions</B>
from your DLL so that the XCenter can query your DLL about the plug-ins which are
contained in it.

</OL>You will find detailed information about this in the XWorkplace source code.
For an introduction, look at the <CODE>PROGREF.INF</CODE> file in the sources'
main directory.
