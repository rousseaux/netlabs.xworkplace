<BODY>
To <B>add a new widget</B> to the XCenter, right-click on an empty space on the XCenter
bar and select <B>"Add widget".</B> A submenu appears which lists all available widget
types. Select one from that list, and a new widget will appear in the XCenter.

<P>The contents of that menu will depend on whether widgets have already been added
to the XCenter and how many plug-in DLLs are contained in the <CODE>plugins\xcenter</CODE>
directory of the XWorkplace installation directory.

<P>The exception to this rule are the "object button" widgets, which represent any
WPS object. These widgets can be used to display the contents of a folder
(similar to XFolder's <A HREF="menu_6favorite.html">folder content menus</A>),
if the object is a folder, or to quick-start an object in its default view, if the object
is not a folder.

<P>In order to add such an object button widget, simply drag the object onto the
XCenter, like this:

<BR><IMG SRC="ctr_drag.gif">

<P>To <B>remove a widget</B> again, right-click on it and select "Remove widget"
from the widget's context menu.

<BR>
