<B>Class: XFolder</B><HR>

<P>The XFolder WPS class enables you to freely add new items to the context menu
of all folders on your system.
<P>Here's a screenshot for the preset XFolder configuration (as defined by the install script):
<P><IMG SRC="menu1.gif">
<P>(Obviously, this screenshot was taken on a German OS/2 version, but this shouldn't
make any difference.)
<P>You will see the same new popup items on all folders on your system.
What happens now if you press
one of the items in the submenu is that XFolder performs the selected action on just the folder
that the context menu was opened for.
<P>The default options installed by installation script are:

<UL><LI>The <STRONG>"Command lines"</STRONG> submenu contains four items for OS/2 and DOS command lines, in
a window and in fullscreen, respectively. If you select any of these,
a command session will be started with the directory of the folder already changed to.
This way you don't have to <CITE>"cd"</CITE> your way through a whole directory tree in order to perform
command line actions on a certain folder.

<BR><LI>The <STRONG>"Create another"</STRONG> submenu contains items for quickly creating certain objects
in the selected folder, without having to open the Templates folder every time. Presently,
you can create folders and (empty) program objects this way.
<P>See <A HREF="menu_2template.html">"Creating objects with XFolder"</A> for more.

<BR><LI>The <STRONG>"Quick Settings"</STRONG> submenu offers a few handy settings
for folders with a single mouse click, instead of having to go into the settings notebook
and click through several pages. Here you will find "Always sort this folder" and
items for changing the icon sizes and such.

<!-- V0.9.0: change XFolder to XWorkplace -->
<BR><LI>The <STRONG>"XWorkplace"</STRONG> submenu contains items for opening this online help and
opening the XFolder Configuration Folder, which is described on a
<A HREF="menu_3config.html">separate page</A>.

<!-- this paragraph modified with V0.81 -->
<BR><LI>The <STRONG>"Netscape (DDE)"</STRONG> item will make Netscape display the
directory of the respective current folder.
(This item was only installed if Netscape was found on your PATH.)
For this, XFolder uses its <B>"Netscape DDE Interface"</B>
(<CITE>NETSCDDE.EXE</CITE>), which is
<!-- V0.9.0: change XFolder to XWorkplace -->
included with the XWorkplace package and will check
if Netscape is already running; if so, the running instance will be used for
displaying the folder instead of always starting a new copy of Netscape.
(See <A HREF="080related.html">"Related files"</A> for more.)

<!-- this paragraph added with V0.81 -->
<BR><LI>The <STRONG>"Treesize"</STRONG> item (which was new with XFolder V0.81)
will display a new window showing
you the subdirectory tree of the current folder with the disk usage for each
subdirectory.
For this, XFolder uses the <CITE>TREESIZE.EXE</CITE> program, which is also
<!-- V0.9.0: change XFolder to XWorkplace -->
included with the XWorkplace package.
(See <A HREF="080related.html">"Related files"</A> for more.)

<!-- this paragraph added with V0.81 -->
</UL>XFolder lets you freely modify these context menu items. See
<A HREF="menu_3config.html">"Configuring context menus"</A> for details.
