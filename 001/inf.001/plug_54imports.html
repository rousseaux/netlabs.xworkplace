        Step 4: Importing functions from XFLDR.DLL
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<!-- This is all new with V0.9.9. -->
<BODY>
As you might imagine, there is plenty of useful code in <CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE> --
for graphics, strings, PM controls, and much more. Most of what you see in the
"&xwp; helpers" sources is probably in <CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE> somewhere.

<P>Now, if you want to use that code, you basically have two options.

<OL><LI>Copy and paste the functions from the helpers sources (or wherever else
from) into your widget code.

<P><LI>The smart way to do this however would be to avoid duplicate code and
use the code from <CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE>. The XCenter interfaces allow you to
do exactly that:

<P>When your DLL's "init" export gets called (ordinal 1), it receives the module
handle of <CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE>. You can then use <CODE>DosQueryProcAddr</CODE>
to resolve the addresses of functions which are exported from <CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE>,
store those function pointers in global variables, and use them instead.

<P>Again, see the standard widgets in <CODE>src\widgets\</CODE> in the &xwp;
sources, which all make use of this feature.

<P>To make sure the prototypes are correct, many prototypes have already been
typedef'd in the various &xwp; header files. Basically, I added a typedef
whenever I needed an export myself. Similarly, in <CODE>src\shared\xwp.def</CODE>,
you will find those functions exported which I needed for the standard plugins.
If you need more functions and prototypes, just contact me, and I'll add them.
