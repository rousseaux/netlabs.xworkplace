<P>The above WWW address always carries both the newest release of XWorkplace
and its complete source code.
You can also find other software there,
including the OS/2 CommandPak, which will enhance your command line environment.

<P>Please read through the
<A HREF="070faq.html">"Frequently Asked Questions"</A>
section before contacting me; maybe you will already find
what you're looking for in there.

<P>I am also now maintaining a <B>public bug list</B> on the XWorkplace homepage.

<P><B>Important note:</B> I will not respond to mails any more
which address problems which are already described at the above locations.
XWorkplace is just becoming too popular by now, and I keep spending half of the time
which could go into enhancing XWorkplace writing to people who are too lazy to read
the documentation. Sorry.

<P><B>Reporting bugs:</B>
<P>If however you still wish to contact me, either because you think you have
found a new bug or you think you have found a solution (which is still very welcome),
please include the following information:
<UL><LI>Please describe the situation in which the error occured and whether it is
reproduceable.
<BR><LI>Include the <B>OS/2 version</B> you are running
(Warp 3 or 4, and
possible fixpaks installed).
<BR><LI>Include a list of <B>other WPS enhancers</B> you are running.
<BR><LI>Look in the root directory of your boot drive for a file
named <B>"XFLDTRAP.LOG";</B>
if it exists, please include it in your message.
<BR><LI>If you are running into problems with the eXtended Shutdown / Restart WPS features,
please switch on the automatic log function on the "XDesktop" page of the Desktop's
settings notebook. This will create a file named <B>"XSHUTDWN.LOG"</B> in the same
location during shutdown. Please include this file also.

</UL>If you're a programmer, you might want to take a look at the <B>source code</B> also.
Maybe you can find a bug yourself.
<BR>
