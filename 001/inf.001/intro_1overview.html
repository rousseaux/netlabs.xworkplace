<BODY>
XWorkplace has several "subcomponents", if you want. Most of the new features
are hooked into the WPS by replacing a number of WPS classes.

<P>
<B>Note:</B> Most XWorkplace features are disabled per default to prevent problems already
after XWorkplace has been installed, because these might cause problems on some
systems. In order to get these to work, open the new <B>"XWorkplace Setup" object</B>
and go to the "Features" page, where you will find everything.
See <A HREF="0634intro_system.html">XWorkplace Settings Objects</A> for details.
