<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: replace most "XFolder"'s with "XWorkplace"
     (except for the "XFolder class" references)
     Also see notes below -->
<BODY>
<!-- V0.9.0: add the following line -->
<B>Class: XWPClassList</B>
<!-- V0.9.0: changed the icon -->
<IMG SRC="xclslist.gif" ALIGN=right>
<!-- V0.9.0: add the following line -->
<HR>
<!-- V0.9.0: rewrote the following -->
Starting with V0.9.0, XWorkplace offers you a separate "WPS Class List" object,
which replaces the settings page which used to be in the "Workplace Shell" object.
With this new object, you may view many WPS internals and manipulate the WPS
class list, i.e. register, deregister, replace and un-replace classes.
<P>In order to use this object successfully,
<!-- V0.9.0: the following is unchanged -->
it might be helpful to have a general
understanding of what WPS classes actually do. The following information is supposed
to assist you in this.
<P>You have probably heard many times that the OS/2 Workplace Shell is
<B>"object-oriented".</B>
This term suggests that -- opposed to other user interfaces, such as that of Windows 3.1
-- everything the Workplace Shell deals with is supposed to be an <B>"object"</B>: this
applies, for example, to files, folders, printers, drives etc. All these objects have
certain common characteristics, such as context menus and settings notebooks, but
differ in certain others: e.g. what you see in a context menu is different depending
on the selected object.
<P>In order to better be able to handle these common and different characteristics, the
WPS uses <B>"classes"</B>. This term has been taken from object-oriented programming;
a class is, so-to-say, an abstract concept for an object. A class is therefore not
visible on the Desktop, it thus does not "exist" in the same sense as objects do,
but it contains all the information about properties and capabilities of an object.
<P>Now, every object on the Desktop is a so-called <B>"instance"</B> of a class.
The names of most of the WPS classes start with "WP": for example, a printer is an
instance of the "WPPrinter" class, a folder one of the class "WPFolder", a datafile
of "WPDataFile" and so on.
<P>The reason for the power and flexibility of the class concept is that the different
classes may <B>descend</B> from each other. A class which is descended from an other
class <B>inherits</B> all of its properties and capabilities. It is thus possible
to make certain features of the user-interface more abstract, according to the
old principle: the best way to handle complexity is abstraction.
<P>One can also apply the concept of classes to things in the "real" world to clarify
it: for example, think of several classes named "Animal", "Mammal", "Dog", and "Bird".
The classes "Mammal" and "Bird" would then be descendants of the "Animal" class,
while "Dog" would descend from "Mammal". Your own dog would then be an instance of
the "Dog" class, so-to-say. Its behavior would be determined by the classes
"Animal", "Mammal", and "Dog" altogether.
<P>The WPS now contains many classes, which make up a very thoughtful
<B>inheritance hierarchy.</B> The following excerpt from the WPS class list may
make the general structure more lucid (where the lines signify inheritance):
<PRE>
   WPObject
     ÃÄÄ WPAbstract
     ³     ÃÄÄ WPPrinter
     ³     ÃÄÄ WPProgram
     ³     ÀÄÄ WPShadow
     ÃÄÄ WPFileSystem
     ³     ÃÄÄ WPDataFile
     ³     ³      ÃÄÄ WPIcon
     ³     ³      ÀÄÄ WPProgramFile
     ³     ÀÄÄ WPFolder
     ³            ÃÄÄ WPDesktop
     ³            ÀÄÄ WPStartup
     ÀÄÄ WPTransient
</PRE>
<BR>You see that all classes are descendants of <B>WPObject</B>. This is the so-called
"root class" of all WPS classes and contains all the features that are common to
all WPS objects: as mentioned before, e.g. context menus and settings notebooks.
However, the WPObject class is too abstract to have instances of it: this class was
only implemented to have other descendant classes. Objects of this class will not
function.
<P>WPObject has only three descendant classes. All these classes are -- like WPObject
-- only meant to be abstract parent classes, of which no objects should exist directly.
<UL><LI><B>WPAbstract</B> is the common parent class for so-called "abstract" objects,
i.e. those objects which do not physically exist on disk, but only store their data
in OS2.INI and OS2SYS.INI. The most well-known examples for this are the above-shown
classes WPPrinter for printer objects, WPProgram for program objects, and WPShadow for
shadows. All these objects do appear in folders, but are not visible if you enter
<CITE>DIR</CITE> at the command line, for example.
<BR><LI>By contrast, <B>WPFileSystem</B> is the common superclass for objects which
do exist physically in a file system of a drive. There are two subtypes: folders (WPFolder
class) and data files (WPDataFile). In turn, there are several subclasses of WPDataFile,
like WPIcon for icon files (<CITE>.ICO</CITE> extension) and WPProgramFile for
program files (e.g. <CITE>.EXE</CITE> extension). All data files for which no more
specific subclass exists are instances of WPDataFile.
<BR><LI>Finally, <B>WPTransient</B> is used by the WPS for objects which need not
save their data at all, but only exist temporarily for representing something. Examples
of this are print jobs in a printer object and all the devices in Warp 4's Hardware
Manager.

</UL>The WPS also offers an exceptional mechanism called <B>class replacements</B>.
This feature is used extensively by XWorkplace to hook all of its features into the WPS by
replacing a number of WPS classes. For example, the <B>XFolder</B> class itself replaces
the WPFolder class to implement the new folder features. Such a replacement class must
always be a descendant of the class which it should replace; "replacing" the class then
means that the WPS will always use the replacement class whenever the original class
would normally be used. As a result, if you have XFolder installed, all folders of
your system are no longer instances of WPFolder, but of XFolder. But since XFolder is
a descendant of WPFolder, only those folder characteristics change for which XFolder
provides additional functionality.
<P>All WPS classes reside in <B>dynamic link libraries</B> (file extension .DLL).
For example, most of the default WPS classes reside in the large
<CITE>PMWP.DLL</CITE> file in the <CITE>\OS2\DLL</CITE> directory. All XWorkplace classes
reside in <CITE>XFLDR.DLL</CITE> in the XWorkplace installation directory.
<P>Using this feature enables programmers to implement new features for a class without
having to know in detail how a certain class works internally. As was said before, this
is an outstanding and powerful concept, which still only OS/2 offers.
<P>Please note that if you attempt to deregister certain OS/2 system classes (which
you normally shouldn't do anyway), this will probably have no effect if the DLL containing
that class contains other WPS classes which are still registered. This applies
especially to the OS/2 Warp 4 Multimedia classes: all those are contained in
<CITE>MMPARTS.DLL</CITE>, and as long as one of these classes is still registered, all
the multimedia classes will still be loaded, even if they don't appear in the WPS
class list.
<!-- V0.9.0: updated the following -->
<P>Again, this is only a short introduction to the WPS class list. If you open the
<B>"WPS Class List" object,</B>
all of the classes installed on your
system will be displayed. Regularily, these will be more than 100 classes, which will
appear in a tree structure. Using context menus, you may register and replace classes
here and also deregister classes and undo class replacements. Also, you can attempt
to create an object (that is: an instance) of many classes on your Desktop.
<P>Please note that you should be <B>very careful</B> when manipulating the WPS class
list. With the aid of this object you may render your OS/2 system unusable in seconds!
<P>Select the <B>"Help"</B> menu item of the class list object (or press F1)
to receive more detailed information.
