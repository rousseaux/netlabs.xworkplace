        New "Sound" Object

        064intro_sounds.html file. -->

<IMG SRC="config_8sounds.gif">
XWorkplace can <B>enhance the "Sound" object</B> by replacing
the "Sound" page in that object to allow changing and organizing system sounds
more easily.

<P>In order to use this feature, you need to have the <B>XWPSound</B>
replacement class installed.

<P>The main enhancement to the "Sound" page is the support for <B>"sound schemes",</B>
which IBM half-introduced with OS/2 Warp 4. The main problem with sound schemes was
however that it was nearly impossible to define one's own schemes without messing
with the system INI files directly.

<P>XWorkplace's new "Sound" page has a new interface which allows you to quickly
select a sound scheme, save your current system sounds as a new sound scheme,
and delete existing schemes. I have designed this interface to be similar to that
of Windows 95, which, in this one case, I consider quite well done. Since the
new "Sound" page handles sound schemes already, the original Warp 4 "Sound schemes"
page is no longer displayed.

<P><B>Warp 3 users</B> might be happy to find out that these sound schemes now
work on their operating system too. To be more precise, the "Sound" page lets you
<I>organize</I> your sounds on Warp 3 as well; however, you still won't get sound scheme
support in your Layout Palette
(which, on Warp 4, allows you to specify different sounds for each folder).

<P>Press <B>"Help"</B> on the new "Sound" page to receive more detailed instructions.

<P><B>Note:</B> System sounds are stored in the <CODE>MMPM.INI</CODE> file in
your <CODE>MMOS2</CODE> directory, while sound schemes (for some reason only IBM knows)
are stored in <CODE>OS2SYS.INI</CODE>. I have stuck to this in order not to break
compatibility. As a consequence, however, all users on your system share the same
system sounds and sound schemes, even if you have different Desktops
(and <CODE>OS2.INI</CODE> files) for each user. Sorry, complain at IBM (as if that helped).

<P>The "Sound" object replacement works regardless of whether you have enabled
the new system sounds (see the <A HREF="mm_2sounds.html">next page</A>).

<P>If you want the "Sound" object replacement only, without the new system sounds,
disable "Extended system sounds" feature on the "Features" page of the
<A HREF="sys_2global.html">"XWorkplace Setup" object.</A>

<P>To disable the "Sound" object replacement, deregister the XWPSound class from
the <A HREF="sys_2global.html">"XWorkplace Setup" object.</A>
