<BODY>
There is no real installation for NetscDDE because XWorkplace comes preconfigured
to let you use it. The <A HREF="menu_1default.html">default configuration</A>
adds a "Netscape DDE" item to all folder context menus which displays the contents of
that folder in Netscape.
<P>
However, there are a few extra things you can do with NetscDDE.
<OL><LI>Create a program object for the <CODE>NETSCDDE.EXE</CODE> file in
the <CODE>/BIN</CODE> subdirectory of the XWorkplace installation directory.
Associate this program object with <CODE>*.HTM</CODE> and <CODE>*.HTML</CODE>
files, and you can then double-click on HTML files on your hard disk and
have NetscDDE open them.
<P><LI>You can also specify NetscDDE as your default browser in the OS/2 Warp 4
URL objects.
