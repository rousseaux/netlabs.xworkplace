XFolder can monitor open Tree views of folders
and automatically scroll down the folder window if necessary.
<P>You have probably encountered this situation a zillion times: you wish to expand a tree
of a folder Tree view which is visible at the bottom of the folder window.
<BR><IMG SRC="intro_4treeviews1.gif">
<P>Normally, if you click on the "plus" sign next to the "dll" directory, the tree will
expand, but you will not be able to see its contents.
This default OS/2 behavior is really tiresome, because almost every other
time that a Tree view is expanded, you'll have to scroll down manually to actually
see the contained objects.
<P>XFolder will now <I>automatically</I> scroll down the folder window if
the newly appearing items begin to appear outside the currently visible window area:
<BR><IMG SRC="intro_4treeviews2.gif">
<P>XFolder does this by internally monitoring the Tree view in the background
after you click on the "plus" sign and then, as soon as the WPS is done
populating the folder, automatically scrolls down. This "monitoring" does not cause
an additional CPU load, because XFolder simply intercepts a single window
notification message internally. (For this reason it is totally inconceivable
that IBM has not implemented this behavior already.)
<P>XFolder will make the bottom-most item that was displayed visible, unless
the tree below the folder you clicked on contains too many items to fit into the
window. In this case, XFolder will scroll the item which you expanded to the very
top of the visible window area.
<P>It is probably the best thing to try out this function yourself, in order to get used
to it. The OS/2 directory is a good candidate for this.
Although this behavior might seem confusing at first, I'm sure that
after a while, you'll probably don't want to miss it.
<P>You can still disable this feature in the
<A HREF="sys_2global.html">Global Settings</A>.
