There are several ways to move between desktops in PageMage:

<UL><LI>Click on the appropriate desktop in the <B>PageMage window</B>
with the left mouse button.

<!-- Move the mouse pointer to the edge of one screen,
and "push" towards another desktop.  -->

<P><LI>You can use <B>special global hotkeys</B> for switching between desktops.
Those are the cursor arrow keys plus any combination of the
Ctrl, Alt and Shift modifiers.

<P>You can change the modifiers in the new
<A HREF="sys_1intro.html">"Screen" settings object,</A>
but the arrow keys are hard-coded into PageMage and cannot be changed.

<P>Those hotkeys work even if you have &xwp;'s
<A HREF="mouse_81objhotkeys.html">global object hotkeys</A> disabled.
However, these hotkeys must be turned on first, which can be done in the
"Screen" settings object as well.
