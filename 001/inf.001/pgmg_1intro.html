PageMage was originally a freeware program written by Carlos Ugarte. From what I know,
the last public version was 0.36. Since the author no longer had the time to work on
it, he published the sources under the GPL, so I was able to integrate it into
XWorkplace.

<P>PageMage is initially disabled. To turn it on, go to the "Features" page in the
<A HREF="sys_2global.html">"XWorkplace Setup" object</A> and check the respective box.
This requires that the <B>XWorkplace PM hook</B> also be installed.

<P>PageMage is a <B>virtual desktop utility for OS/2.</B> Essentially, it allows
the user to work on several desktops at once. Your screen is considered one out
of several, and you can switch between these. This effectively multiplies your
working area since windows can reside outside your currently visible desktop and
still be switched to simply by switching to another desktop.

<P><IMG SRC="pagemage.gif">

<P>Traditionally, most virtual desktop programs show a representation of the
overall desktop in a window, highlighting the current desktop. The standard
mechanism for switching desktops has been to click (with a mouse) on one
of the other desktops, which would remove the current desktop's windows
and display the new desktop's windows.

<P>PageMage can be <B>configured</B> in the new
<A HREF="sys_1intro.html">"Screen" settings object,</A> where
XWorkplace inserts several pages.

<P>There are still some bugs in PageMage. Some have always been in there, and some
are due to the integration into XWorkplace.
