  /*
   *@@ WIDGETSETTINGSDLGDATA:
   *      a bunch of data passed to a "show settings
   *      dialog" function (WGTSHOWSETTINGSDLG), if
   *      the widget has specified such a thing.
   *
   *      XCenter widget settings dialogs basically
   *      work as follows:
   *
   *      1.  You must a function that displays a modal
   *          dialog. This function must have the following
   *          prototype:
   *
   +              VOID EXPENTRY ShowSettingsDlg(PWIDGETSETTINGSDLGDATA pData)
   *
   *      2.  Store that function in the
   *          XCENTERWIDGETCLASS.pShowSettingsDlg field for
   *          your widget class.
   *
   *          This will enable the "Properties" menu item
   *          for the widget.
   *
   *      3.  Your function gets called when the user selects
   *          "Properties". What that function does, doesn't
   *          matter... it should however display a modal
   *          dialog and update the widget's settings string
   *          and call ctrSetSetupString with the "hSettings"
   *          handle that was given to it in the
   *          WIDGETSETTINGSDLGDATA structure. This will give
   *          the widget the new settings.
   *
   *          The address of the ctrSetSetupString helper is
   *          given to you in this structure so that you
   *          won't have to import it from XFLDR.DLL.
   *
   *      If a widget class supports settings dialogs,
   *      it must specify this in its XCENTERWIDGETCLASS.
