<!-- This file is all new with V0.82. -->
<!-- changes for V0.83 and V0.84: see below -->
<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: replace XFolder with &xwp;;
                          also see notes below -->

<OL><LI><B>The WPS crashes/keeps rebooting after the Desktop restart. What is this?</B>
<P>Difficult to say. If it keeps rebooting, this is a sure sign that the WPS is
trapping, i.e. exceptions occur when it's booting up. Same thing as
on the <A HREF="faq_01general.html">previous page</A>, &xwp;
seems to be conflicting with other WPS extensions.
<P>Otherwise, it might simply be that restarting the WPS is not working on your system.
The Desktop restart is only intended as a shortcut, but if it doesn't
work, try rebooting instead.
<!-- this paragraph added with V0.82 -->
<P>Some people have reported that removing &xwp; INI keys seems to help. Take some
INI editor and look in OS2.INI for application names starting with "XFolder". Delete
them all. &xwp; does not <I>rely</I> on INI keys any more. This will
delete all your settings and reset the language to English, but maybe &xwp; will
run.
<!-- this paragraph added with V0.82 -->
<P>In addition, it is always recommended to have more recent &os2; fixpaks applied,
that is, at least Fixpak 35 for Warp 3 and fixpak 5 for Warp 4. &xwp; will run
without fixpaks, but this might lead to problems.
IBM has changed many things with the SOM kernel over time, which the WPS uses for
its class management. I have tried my best to enhance compatibility, but I cannot
test all possible configurations myself. I have found, for example, that the
standard Warp 3 SOM kernel is extremely buggy,
so at least for Warp 3 I <I>strongly</I> recommend applying
fixpaks.
<!-- V0.9.13: removed this
(Although since XFolder V0.82, I am checking installation on Warp 3 without
fixpaks.) -->

<P><LI><B>The install program says that some of the classes could not be installed.
What can I do?</B>
<P>There were serious installation problems with the previous V0.8x versions.
Apparently, with V0.82, things have become much better since I've removed
SOM multiple inheritance, which the WPS apparently doesn't like too much on some
systems.
<P>&xwp; 0.9.0's classes have been redesigned to allow for installation of
only some of the classes, which was not possible with previous versions. Only two
classes are required now (XFldObject, which replaces WPObject, and XWPSetup,
the "&xwp; Setup" object). Open "&xwp; Setup" and
press the "Classes" button on the "Features" page. This will show you all the
classes which have been properly installed and allows you to change the class
setup. Maybe this helps.

<P><LI><B>The install program does not create the "&os2; Kernel" and "Workplace Shell"
objects.</B>
<P>With V0.80, the install script failed to create the
new system objects if the XFolder config folder already existed. This should be
fixed now, but if problems persist, simply delete your config
folder, and all the objects should be created.
<P>Otherwise, you can still execute the
<CODE>INSTLxxx.CMD</CODE> and <CODE>CROBJxxx.CMD</CODE> scripts in the
<CODE>INSTALL</CODE> subdirectory, with "xxx" being your three-digit language code,
as described on the <A HREF="inst_4nls.html">"NLS"</A> page.
<P>However, this might also be due to the fact that the "XFldSystem" and "XFldWPS"
classes could not be properly registered. I have seen this happen on a Warp 3
system without any fixpaks installed. -->
