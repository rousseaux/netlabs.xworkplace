<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.0 -->
<BODY>
With the release of &xwp; V0.9.0, the
<B>version numbering format has been altered.</B> Similar to the Linux
version numbering, we now have three sub-digits in the version number, which is now
in the format <CODE>major.minor.revision</CODE>.

<!-- V0.9.3: added this paragraph -->
<P>As with Linux, <B>odd minor numbers</B> are used for "developer releases" which
are not guaranteed to be stable. After several developer releases, if the code is
considered to be stable, the next version will get an <B>even minor number.</B>
<!-- V0.9.21: changed this -->
So, for example, after V0.9.81, V1.0.0 might be released.

<P>This has been changed to make clear
which <A HREF="inst_4nls.html">National Language Support (NLS) packages</A> can be
used for a particular &xwp; release: An NLS package which has the same major and
minor version numbers as the &xwp; base package can be used with that version.

<!-- V0.9.3: added this paragraph -->
<P>This does not apply to developer releases. So if you have an odd minor number,
for example, with all V0.9.x releases, use only the NLS package with exactly the
same version number.

<!-- V0.9.3: removed all this
In other words, if only the revision part is raised, NLS packages for the
previous version will still be working.
Note that the revision number will be raised for each single release,
even if the previous release was called a "beta" version. I only add the "beta" if I
think that a release has not been tested enough to be considered stable. If there is
a "beta" version, there will never be a non-beta version with the same version number,
but the release number will be raised for the non-beta release. -->
