<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.0 -->
<BODY>
With the release of &xwp; V0.9.0, the
<B>version numbering format has been altered.</B> Similar to the Linux
version numbering, we now have three sub-digits in the version number, which is now
in the format <CODE>major.minor.revision</CODE>.

<!-- V0.9.3: added this paragraph -->
<P>As with Linux, <B>odd minor numbers</B> are used for "developer releases" which
are not guaranteed to be stable. After several developer releases, if the code is
considered to be stable, the next version will get an <B>even minor number.</B>

<!-- V1.0.0: changed this -->
<p>So version 1.0.0 means that the code is considered ready for general use.

<!-- V1.0.0: removed all the rest -->
