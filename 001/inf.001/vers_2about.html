<!-- this page is all new with V1.00 -->
<BODY>
With the release of XWorkplace V0.9.0, the
<B>version numbering format has been altered.</B> Similar to the Linux
version numbering, we now have three sub-digits in the version number, which is now
in the format <CODE>major.minor.revision</CODE>.
<P>This has been changed to make clear
which <A HREF="inst_4nls.html">National Language Support (NLS) packages</A> can be
used for a particular XWorkplace release: An NLS package which has the same major and
minor version numbers as the XWorkplace base package can be used with that version.
<P>In other words, if only the <CODE>revision</CODE> part is raised, NLS packages for the
previous version will still be working.
<P>Note that the <CODE>revision</CODE> number will be raised for each single release,
even if the previous release was called a "beta" version. I only add the "beta" if I
think that a release has not been tested enough to be considered stable. If there is
a "beta" version, there will never be a non-beta version with the same version number,
but the <CODE>release</CODE> number will be raised for the non-beta release.
