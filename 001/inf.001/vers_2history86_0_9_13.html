<P><B>XWorkplace 0.9.13 (June 3, 2001)</B>

<P>New features:

<UL><LI>XCenter: Added tray widgets, per popular request.
<P><LI>XCenter: Added "Spacing lines" setting to XCenter view styles.
<P><LI>XCenter: Added drop support and in-use emphasis to object button widgets.
<P><LI>XCenter: Added detailed system information to tooltips for pulse and sentinel
widgets.

</UL><P>Miscellaneous changes:

<UL><LI>Removed the temporary archive marker file that was previously used to check
for whether a WPS archive was just restored. Thanks, Stefan Mielcke.
<P><LI>"Sort" menu: Per popular request, the menu is dismissed again, unless shift
is held down while clicking or "always sort" or "folders first" were clicked on.
<P><LI>"Multimedia" object: Device detection on page 1 was completely rewritten.
Hopefully this fixes the system hangs some people experienced with buggy multimedia
drivers. While I was at it, I added lots of information to the display.
<P><LI>Font sample view: default window size was a bit small. Fixed, now using almost
the whole screen.
<P><LI>XCenter: Made some xwplog.log messages more verbose.

</UL>Bugfixes:

<UL><LI>General: Added lots of new checks for audio CDs in the library code. This should
finally prevent the stupid white error boxes on WPS startup, with the status bars
in the "Drives" folder, and on disk double-clicks if an audio CD was inserted in a
CD-ROM drive.
<P><LI>"Sort" menu: Fixed confusion with check marks in certain situations.
<P><LI>XCenter: "Add widget" menu never worked with sliding menus enabled. Fixed.
<P><LI>XCenter: Paul Ratcliffe fixed the context menu font.
<P><LI>XCenter: Fixed a memory leak on widget destruction.
<P><LI>XCenter: Tooltips weren't managed properly for widgets that were just created
or destroyed by the user. Fixed.
<P><LI>XCenter: Fixed minor pointer change problem while settings dialog was displayed.
<P><LI>System sounds: Changes in 0.9.13 caused Win-OS/2 to complain that sound device
was busy. Fixed, hopefully.
<P><LI>"Snap to grid" page: Values for Y origin and Y spacing were confused. Fixed.
<P><LI>Boot logos: "Undo" button on "Startup" page in desktop's settings notebook
never restored the boot logo file setting, which could lead to trouble if your boss
came into the office. Fixed; thanks, Steve Wendt, for pointing this out.
<P><LI>XShutdown: daemon crashed during shutdown if hook wasn't active. Fixed.
<P><LI>XShutdown: 0.9.12 code broke WM_SAVEAPPLICATION behavior for some apps. Fixed;
went back to pre-0.9.12 code there.
<P><LI>XShutdown: Shutdown thread kept marching even if an exception was currently
being processed on another thread, which prevented the trap logs from being written.
Fixed, shutdown thread is now waiting if an exception handler is running somewhere.
