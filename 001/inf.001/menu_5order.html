<!-- V0.9.0: add the following line -->
<B>Class: XFolder</B><HR>
Since V0.60 you may (finally) change the order of menu items within a context menu
or one of its submenus. (Previously, this was really tiresome to accomplish.)
<P>Simply open the XFolder Configuration Folder or one of its subfolders
<UL><LI>either in Details view
<BR><LI>or in Icon view; for this, however, you will have to enable "Flowed"
or "Nonflowed" on the "Display" page in this folder's settings notebook.
(This is more quickly to accomplish with the XFolder "Small icons in icon and tree views"
menu items, by the way.)

</UL>If you now change the order of the objects in this folder with the mouse (drag and drop)
<STRONG>and then</STRONG> close this configuration folder, you will see that the
order of menu items has changed accordingly.
