<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: replace XFolder with XWorkplace -->
<BODY>
There are a number of files in the different subdirectory of the XWorkplace
installation directory that might be useful to you:

<!-- this item changed with V0.83 -->
<UL><LI><CITE><STRONG>BOOTMGR.CMD</STRONG></CITE> is new with V0.83.
This script was supplied by
Duane A. Chamblee <duanec@ibm.net> and will automatically add all the
current BootManager choices to the XWorkplace user-reboot actions for XShutdown.
This is done by modifying the XWorkplace keys in OS2.INI directly. No guarantee
that this will actually work on your system!

<P><LI><CITE><STRONG>CROBJxxx.CMD</STRONG></CITE>
(with xxx being a three-digit language code,
as described in <A HREF="inst_4nls.html">National Language Support</A>) are used
by XWorkplace to create the default Configuration Folders. These are just plain REXX
scripts which create a number of objects on your desktop.
<P>These scripts are called both after XWorkplace has been installed (after the first
WPS restart) and also whenever XWorkplace fails to locate its Configuration Folder.
<P>You may modify these scripts to have a different default configuration created.
However, you should be very careful in changing the various object settings, especially
the <CITE>OBJECTID</CITE> keywords, because XWorkplace might rely on these.

<P><LI><CITE><STRONG>NEWOBJ.CMD</STRONG></CITE>
was used in previous versions of XWorkplace
(before 0.52)
to create objects. This is
<A HREF="menu_2template.html">now done with templates,</A> but this script is still
included, for those who got used to it.
<P>It needs the following parameters on the command line:
<PRE>newobj &lt;wpsclass&gt; &lt;name&gt;</PRE>
<P>It will create a new instance of <CITE>&lt;wpsclass&gt;</CITE> with the title
<CITE>&lt;name&gt;</CITE> in the current directory. Please
see the <A HREF="xices_1wpsclasses.html">"WPS Classes" page</A> for a list of WPS classes.
Not all of these make sense when
creating objects though.
<P>Here's an example:
<PRE>newobj WPFolder New_Folder</PRE>
<P>will create a new folder called "New_Folder" in the current directory.
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Since V0.41, XFolder can also create objects
from templates. This has the advantage that you can create objects with certain
default settings (namely for folders).

<!-- this item changed with V0.84 -->
<P><LI><CITE><STRONG>NETSCDDE.EXE</STRONG></CITE> (The Netscape DDE Interface):
see the <A HREF="069netscdde.html">separate chapter</A> in this documentation.

<!-- xxx -->
<P><LI><CITE><STRONG>REPCLASS.EXE</STRONG></CITE>
is used by the installation script to register the various XWorkplace class and replace
WPFolder with it. It needs the following parameters on the command line:
<PRE>repclass &lt;oldclass&gt; &lt;replacewithclass&gt; [&lt;dllname&gt;]</PRE>
<P><CITE>&lt;oldclass&gt;</CITE> is the WPS class that you wish to replace.
This is case-sensitive.
<P><CITE>&lt;replacewithclass&gt;</CITE> is the new
WPS class that you wish to register and at the same
time replace <CITE>&lt;oldclass&gt;</CITE> with. This is also case-sensitive.
<P><CITE>&lt;dllname&gt;</CITE> is the dynamic link library (DLL) that
contains <CITE>&lt;replacewithclass&gt;</CITE>.
If the DLL is not on the LIBPATH (as with XFolder), you will need
to specify the full path.
<P>If <CITE>&lt;dllname&gt;</CITE> is omitted, <CITE>&lt;replacewithclass&gt;</CITE>
will be de-registered and removed
from the replacement list for <CITE>&lt;oldclass&gt;</CITE>.
<P>Example for XWorkplace itself: the classes to be replaced are
<CITE>WPFolder</CITE>, <CITE>WPDisk</CITE>, and <CITE>WPSystem</CITE>, the
new XFolder classes are <CITE>XFolder</CITE>, <CITE>XFldDisk</CITE>, and <CITE>XFldSystem</CITE>,
which all reside in the XFLDR.DLL file.
<P>All action performed with this program will only have an effect after rebooting or restarting
the WPS with WPSRESET.EXE (see below).
<P><B>Warning:</B> Do not attempt to replace single XWorkplace classes or to undo
a certain XWorkplace replacement manually. The XWorkplace classes are designed to work
together and are depend on each other. If you register / deregister not all of them,
the WPS might hang itself up already at boot-up. For registering or deregistering
of the XWorkplace classes, always use the install script.

<P><LI><CITE><STRONG>SOUNDxxx.CMD</STRONG></CITE>
(with xxx being a three-digit language code,
as described in <A HREF="inst_4nls.html">National Language Support</A>) must be started
by you to activate the new <A HREF="064intro_sounds.html">system sounds</A>.
These little scripts will write a few language-dependent
strings into the INI files of the OS/2
Multimedia Subsystem (MMPM/2), which will then be visible in the OS/2 "Sound" object.
Only if XWorkplace finds these, it will play system sounds
at all.

<P><LI><CITE><STRONG>SOUNDOFF.CMD</STRONG></CITE>
will turn sounds off again by deleting the respective entries from the MMPM/2 INI files.
XWorkplace will then stop playing system sounds.

<P><B>Note:</B> The <CITE>SOUND</CITE> files assume that that your MMPM/2 directory is <CITE>\MMOS2</CITE>
on your boot drive. If it is not, you must alter the files yourself.

<!-- this item added with V0.81 -->
<P><LI><CITE><STRONG>TREESIZE.EXE</STRONG></CITE> is used by the new default
menu item of the same name and displays the disk usage of a folder and all its
subfolders in a Tree view. If Treesize is started with a directory name as a parameter,
this directory is displayed, or the current directory otherwise.
<P>After Treesize is done with its calculations, you may drag and drop new WPS folders
onto the main window, whose size will be calculated then also.
<P>Treesize offers you some settings using context menus.
<P>All settings are saved when Treesize is closed.

<P><LI><CITE><STRONG>WPSRESET.EXE</STRONG></CITE>
can restart your WPS without rebooting your computer
altogether (see the <A HREF="xsd_1restartwps.html">"Restart WPS"</A> page for details).
It is now (V0.71) only used by the install script any more, while XWorkplace does its
own WPS restarting internally.
In order to prevent accidental execution, WPSRESET.EXE must be started with a
<CITE>"-D"</CITE> parameter on the command line. (I have forgotten what "-D" stands
for, but I'm sure it used to have a meaning.)

<P><LI><CITE><STRONG>XHELP.CMD</STRONG></CITE>
is a powerful REXX script which can display language-dependent messages, both
in HTML and simple ASCII format.
It was taken out of the "OS/2 CommandPak" by the same author,
also available at
<A HREF="http://www2.rz.hu-berlin.de/~h0444vnd/os2.htm">my homepage</A>. In that package, you will
find extensive documentation of xhelp.
<P>In XWorkplace's context, xhelp is only used by the install program and has no further function.

<P><LI><CITE><STRONG>XSHUTDWN.EXE</STRONG></CITE>: see the respective
<A HREF="xsd_4cmdline.html">separate page.</A>

<P><LI><STRONG>All the other .CMD files</STRONG> in the XWorkplace directory
are REXX scripts used by the default XWorkplace configuration to quickly set
certain folder settings (they can be found in the "Quick Settings" submenu).
The scripts are very similar, varying only in the settings that are applied
to a folder. ALWSSORT.CMD is commented, so you can look through it and see what it
is doing. Copy ALWSSORT.CMD to some other filename and change the settings that
are applied to the folder in order to apply customized settings to folders.
See the <A HREF="xices_30wpsstrings.html">"WPFolder Setup Strings"</A> page for a list of applicable settings.
