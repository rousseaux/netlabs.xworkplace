        Shutting Down from the Command Line

It is possible to start the extended shutdown procedure from the command line as well.
From version 0.80 to 0.9.6, XFolder/XWorkplace used to contain an external executable
for this task. This has been removed with V0.9.7 because it caused too much confusion
since all those command line parameters were not easy to use.

<P>Instead, with V0.9.7, XWorkplace supports external shutdown with the use of
new WPS setup strings for the desktop. In summary, you can invoke the
<CODE>XSHUTDOWNNOW=DEFAULT</CODE> setup string on your desktop, and your system will
be shut down as if you had selected the "Shutdown" menu item from the desktop's
context menu.

<P>For a detailed description of the setup strings available, see the setup strings
for XFldDesktop in the <A HREF="099appendices.html">appendices</A> of this book.
