        Shutting Down from the Command Line

<!-- Changes for V0.83/0.84: see notes at bottom -->
<!-- Changes for V0.9.0: replace XFolder with XWorkplace -->
<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: see notes below -->
<BODY>
<!-- V0.9.0: add the following line -->
<B>Class: XFldObject</B><HR>
Starting with V0.80, XWorkplace contains a little program in the <CODE>BIN</CODE>
subdirectory of the
installation directory to initiate the eXtended Shutdown from the command line.
This program is called <CODE>XSHUTDWN.EXE</CODE>.
<P>Please note that this program alone is not capable of shutting down your system.
All it does is to tell XWorkplace that and how shutdown should be performed. As a result,
it will only function if:
<!-- the following line changed with V0.9.0 -->
<UL><LI>XWorkplace (or XFolder V0.80 or greater) is installed;
<BR><LI>the WPS is up and running
<BR><LI>and no other errors occur. ;-)

</UL>On the other hand, you can put XSHUTDWN.EXE in any directory you like, for example
some directory along your PATH, to be able to access XShutdown from any command line.
XSHUTDWN.EXE does not require the XWorkplace DLLs or any other XWorkplace resource, because
it contacts XShutdown via inter-process communication.
<P>XSHUTDWN.EXE overrides most of the <B>settings</B> you have specified for XShutdown. If you
simply call it without parameters, certain default values will be used, no matter what
your WPS settings are for XShutdown.
<P>However, you can specify something different on the <B>command line</B>
(these switches will not affect your WPS settings for XShutdown, but only
one execution of it):
<DL>
<DT><CODE>-r</CODE>
<DD>will cause XShutdown to <B>reboot</B> your computer,
using the built-in reboot function. The default is not to reboot.
<DT><CODE>  -R &lt;cmd&gt;</CODE>
<DD>will cause XShutdown to reboot your computer using the
<B>user-defined reboot</B> action &lt;cmd&gt;.
<!-- the following two paragraphzs added with V0.9.5 -->
<DT><CODE>  -p </CODE> (new with V0.9.5)
<DD>will do an <B>APM power-off</B>, if supported.
<DT><CODE>  -P </CODE> (new with V0.9.5)
<DD>will do an <B>APM power-off</B>, if supported, but delayed for a few seconds.
<DT><CODE>  -v      </CODE>
<DD>will <B>auto-close VIO</B> windows. Default is not to close them.
<DT><CODE>  -a      </CODE>
<DD>will show an <B>animation</B> when XShutdown is done. Default is not
to show the animation.
<DT><CODE>  -f      </CODE>
<DD>will show <B>no confirmation</B> window. Default is to have
XShutdown confirmed.
<!-- this paragraph added with V0.83 -->
<DT><CODE>  -l </CODE> (new with V0.83)
<DD>will turn on shutdown logging in the <CODE>XSHUTDWN.LOG</CODE> file.
<!-- the following added with V0.84 -->
<DT><CODE>  -w </CODE> (new with V0.84)
<DD>will do a WPS restart instead of a "real" shutdown.
This can be used in conjunction with -f.
<DT><CODE>  -W </CODE> (new with V0.84)
<DD>will also do a WPS restart instead of a "real" shutdown, but also close all
open windows and reuse the startup folder after the WPS restart.
This can be used in conjunction with -f and -v.
