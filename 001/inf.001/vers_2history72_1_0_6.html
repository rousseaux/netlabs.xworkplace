<P><B>&xwp; 1.0.6 (November 9, 2006)</B>

<P>All the bugs below have been fixed by Paul Ratcliffe unless otherwise noted.

<P>Bugfixes:

<UL><LI>Fixed a trap in the daemon when deselecting the XWP Hook with Xcenter's Window List
widget active. Bug 748.

<P><LI>Fixed a trap when double clicking on a section header in the Device Drivers tree on
the Drivers tab of the OS/2 Kernel object. Bug 762.

<P><LI>Fixed cosmetic issues with the Driver description and Parameters boxes on the

<P><LI>Fixed traps and other incorrect behaviour relating to dragging and dropping.
The Trashcan can now accept "discard" objects, like the Shredder.
Bugs 806, 815, 817 and 829. Fixed by Lars Erdmann.

<P><LI>Fixed a problem relating to launching objects using hotkeys, especially with the
XCenter. Bug 792.

<P><LI>XPager window dragging to other virtual desktops now snaps to the same location.
Holding down the Shift key allows windows to be positioned anywhere. This is the reverse
of the previous behaviour, at user request. Bug 733.

<P><LI>The main icon for the "XWorkplace Installation" folder was updated - this was
only partially applied in the previous version. Bug 760.

<P><LI>Fixed a bug with the XShutdown configuration dialog wouldn't switch back from ACPI
to APM shutdown. Bug 728.

<P><LI>Fixed a bug during initial installation of the XCenter where it wasn't adding the
"Desktop Lock", "Find Utility", and "Shutdown" objects. Bug 749.

<P><LI>The XCenter Tray selection bitmap was made bigger to match the other icons. Bug 729.

<P><LI>Fixed bugs with the DEFAULTOBJECT and OPEN setting strings being ignored with
XWPString objects. Bug 823.

<P><LI>Implemented folder setup string DEFAULTVIEW=SPLITVIEW. Fixed OPEN= setup string for
disk objects which was mostly completely unimplemented. Bug 827.

<P><LI>Stopped the Shredder Object from behaving like the Trash Can (except if Shift is
pressed). Bug 413.

<P><LI>The keyboard NumLock LED was not always set correctly when using the
"Enable NumLock on Startup" feature. Bug 831.

<P><LI>The default for XCenter's "Automatically add to screen border" function is now off.
Disabling this setting now also clears the relevant screen border setting.
Fixed Default/Undo processing for XCenter's View properties page. Bug 224.

<P><LI>Printer and Transient objects are now prevented from being moved to the Trash Can.

<P><LI>Showing or maximizing a previously maximized and then minimized view of the WPS
Class List caused the window not to display properly. Also affected Folder Split Views.
Bug 865.

<P><LI>Fixed a bug with XCenter's folder object buttons which sometimes didn't bring
the folder to the top of the Z-order. Bug 319.

<P><LI>Fixed a bug with the Screen borders notebook page where the settings were not
being saved correctly. Bug 56.

<P><LI>Window List size/position and presentation parameters (font/colors) were not
being saved. Bug 458.

<P><LI>Some of the developer documentation was updated. Thanks to Christian Hennecke.
