The following is from the original PageMage documentation by Carlos Ugarte
and lists known problems:

<UL>
<P>
<LI>Some IAK applications (NR/2, FTP-PM most notably)
cause very lengthy delays in PageMage's operation.  I have found the "bug",
but don't really consider it a bug of PageMage.  If WinQueryWindowTitle()
API is called on these windows, it takes an eternity to return (on the IAK
windows).  This call was made by PageMage whenever it switches desktops,
and whenever it must draw the window.  The number of times this call is
being made has been minimized, but you may still experience some delays
- whenever PageMage starts up (if IAK apps are running) or whenever
IAK apps are started (if PageMage) is running.  Thanks to Giles Orr
(giles@gold.interlog.com) and Matteo Castelli (piu1673@cdc8g5.cdc.polimi.it)
for taking the time to determine just what was causing the delay :-).
<P>
<LI>If you drag a window by its Titlebar and try to move
it to another desktop, it "doesn't move".  Actually, this is not true, PageMage
will flip to the new desktop, but the screen does not reflect this.
 What happens is that whenever you move a window (by dragging on its Titlebar,
or selecting move from the System Menu), PM disables any output to the screen.
 Tejaswi Kasturi (kasturi@ccsf.caltech.edu) suggested using <A HREF="032_L2_FeelX.html">FeelX
</A>for this purpose.  Supposedly, this problem no longer appears after
doing so.
<P>
<LI>PageMage causes TaskBar 2.5 to function improperly.  Thanks to Peter Grashoff (grashoff@mmm.xs4all.nl)
for pointing this out.
<P>
<LI>Problems with WebExplorer.  I now run WebEx once in
a while, and now most of the problems are gone.  The PageMage window
may not be 100% correct, but otherwise, everything seems ok.
<P>
<LI>On starting a new program/window, if you quickly switch
desktops, PageMage may get confused.  This happens seldom, but it
is most likely to occur with (you guessed it) WebExplorer (aaargh)...
