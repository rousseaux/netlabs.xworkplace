<B>&xwp; 0.9.18 (February 4, 2002)</B>

<P>New features:

<UL><LI>Mouse: Paul Ratcliffe added the "Screen wrap" feature a la NPSWPS
to the special actions for screen borders.

<P><LI>&pgr;: Holding down the "Shift" key while dragging mini-windows in
the pager window now drags across virtual screens, keeping the window's position.

</UL>Miscellaneous changes:

<UL><LI>Added setting to XWPSetup "Features" page for whether &xwp; should check
the desktop's integrity on startup, since so many people had problems with it.
Added a corresponding flag to the "Panic" dialog also.

<P><LI>Object button widgets are no longer shown in the "Add widget" menu since
they were always disabled anyway.

<P><LI>Saved a previous PM timer in the Worker thread that was used for
close to nothing.

</UL>Bugfixes:

<UL><LI>Common: Fixed another problem with AM/PM (12-hour) time display, which
always ended up with "00:" when "12:" should have been displayed.

<P><LI>Program objects: Fixed a bunch of problems with programs not starting
and the bug that program objects could no longer be created properly at all.
Duh, that was a hard one. Added exception handling to a number of replacement
methods too.

<P><LI>Programs: Fixed memory problems with my WinStartApp wrapper which
sometimes ate parts of the environment of the process to be started.

<P><LI>Turbo folders: Miscellanous fixes for thread synchronization problems which
could lead to duplicate objects for the same file.

<P><LI>Icon replacements: Fixed missing icons with PMMail attachments display.

<P><LI>File dialog: Large number of fixes for duplicate objects in tree view plus
frequent bad scrolling.

<P><LI>XCenter: Knut St. Osmundsen fixed a bunch of display problems introduced
with the recent SMP update. He reported this now works fine on SMP. Display
looks much better now.

<P><LI>&pgr;: Martin Lafaix fixed a large number of glitches with &pgr;'s display
plus some problems with minimized/maximized windows.
