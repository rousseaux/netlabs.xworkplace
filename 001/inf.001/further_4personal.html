Finally, another subjective thesis:
<P>If IBM had managed to push an affordable compiler into
the market just three years earlier, OS/2 would be better positioned today.
<P>At least for me,
not programming OS/2 was not due to a lack of interest, but a lack of money. Both the
freeware/shareware and the commercial market could have been WAY more vital with a
"Turbo Pascal for OS/2". But this problem just matches the general problems
with OS/2: the best technology around, but no interest in the mass market. :-(
<P>BTW, some consolation for depressed OS/2 users can be found on the most excellent web page
"OS/2 Headquarters" by Tom Nadeau at
<A HREF="http://www.mindspring.com/~os2headquarters/">http://www.mindspring.com/~os2headquarters/</A>
with the two excellent, witty series "Understanding Microsoft" and "Understanding IBM", plus
more.
<H6>"Then was the land filled with the sound
of much wailing and gnashing of teeth, for millions of people used
OS/2 and knew that it was good. Yet the Lizard did harden his heart
against them, and said, Nay, there is no demand for it."
