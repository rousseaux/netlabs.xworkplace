        The "Copy Filename" Feature

<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: see notes below -->

<!-- V0.9.0: add the following line -->
<B>Classes: XFldDataFile, XFolder</B><HR>
&xwp; can copy the filename of any file
into the clipboard after you select "Copy filename" from the object's context menu.
Note that this applies to all file-system objects, not just folders; however, this does not
apply to abstract WPS objects (shadows, program objects etc.), because these just
don't have a filename.
<P><IMG SRC="copyfilename.gif">
<P>If you select "Copy filename" <I>without</I> holding down the <B>"Shift" key,</B>
&xwp; will only copy the filename itself.
<P>If you hold down the "Shift" key while selecting "Copy filename", &xwp;
will copy the fully qualified filename, i.e. the drive letter, the path and the filename
itself.
<P>Assuming that the folder in the above screenshot
resides on the Desktop, "Copy filename"
would copy <CITE>"C:\Desktop\Folder"</CITE> into the clipboard, if you hold down the "Shift" key,
<CITE>"Folder"</CITE> otherwise.
<P>This now (V0.80) also works when you have more than one object selected in the folder.
In this case, the filenames of the selected objects are all copied to the clipboard,
separated by spaces.
<P>&xwp; also defines Ctrl+Insert as a default
<A HREF="fldr_5xelerators.html">folder hotkey</A> for copying the filename(s)
of the currently selected object(s).
<P>You can disable the menu item and change the hotkey(s)
in the <A HREF="sys_2global.html">Global Settings</A>.
