<BODY>
<!-- the following lines changed with V0.9.0 -->
Starting with V0.52, &xwp; is capable of supporting other languages
than just English. This is called National Language Support (NLS).
The &xwp; base package comes with English NLS.
<P>
<!-- the following is unchanged -->
For languages other than English however, you will need an
<B>&xwp; National Language Support (NLS) package.</B>
Such a package will contain a number of files, among them
a new Dynamic Link Library (<CODE>.DLL</CODE>) for &xwp; itself,
a new help file (<CODE>.HLP</CODE>) and a new User Guide book (<CODE>.INF</CODE>).
Each of these files carries a three-digit
language code in its respective file name, as defined in the
<A HREF="cmdref.inf#country">&os2; Online Reference</A>. For example,
the English files, which are already
included with &xwp;, all have a "001" code (for US English) in their names.

<P>
Please check <A HREF="http://&xwp;.netlabs.org"><CODE>http://&xwp;.netlabs.org</CODE></A>
for available NLS packages.
<P>
<B>Note that &xwp; does not work with NLS packages written for XFolder V0.8x.</B>
Do not attempt to run this &xwp; version with those NLS packages. Since many
language-dependent items have been rewritten, this will lead to really awkward
behavior of your WPS and probably system crashes also.

<!-- all the following with V0.9.0 -->
<P>
NLS packages are installed using WarpIN too. If you wish to use a language other
than English, after &xwp; has been installed,
do not restart your computer yet, but install your NLS package next.
Then restart the WPS.
<P>
When several languages are installed, the
<A HREF="sys_1intro.html">"&xwp; Setup" object</A> offers you a
"Language" drop-down box to change the current language.
