        Why OpenSource?

<!-- this file is all new with V0.85 -->
<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: replace XFolder with XWorkplace -->
<BODY>
With V0.80, XFolder was placed under the GNU General Public Licence (GPL), and
XWorkplace will continue to be shipped under that licence.

<P>The GPL is a general licence agreement which was developed by the Free Software
Foundation to protect the rights of programmers who wish to publish the source code
of their software. The GPL is most frequently used with software of the GNU project
and has become more widely known with the evolution of Linux, to most parts of which
the GPL applies.

<P>If you're interested in finding out more about OpenSource licencing models and
why I think that all OS/2 freeware developers should release their source codes,
preferrably under some OpenSource licence, please read my article
"Why OpenSource?" in OS/2 e-Zine!, vol. 4, no. 4
(<A HREF="http://www.os2ezine.com/v4n4/open.htm">http://www.os2ezine.com/v4n4/open.htm</A>).
