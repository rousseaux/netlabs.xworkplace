<B>XWorkplace 0.9.8 (January 26, 2001)</B>

<P>New features:
<UL><LI>Added the <A HREF="066xcenter.html">XCenter,</A> a WarpCenter replacement.
<P><LI>Added more items to the context menus on the "File types" page in
"Workplace Shell".
<P><LI>Added "No submenu" setting for "Lock in place" context menu item
("Workplace Shell", "Context menus" page 3).
<P><LI>Added "Logoff network now" to desktop's removeable menu items; shutdown
menu items can also be configured more (desktop settings
notebook, "Menu items" page).
<P><LI>Added "Ignore XCenter" to sliding focus settings ("Mouse", "Movement").
<P><LI>Martin Lafaix contributed the "Resources" page to XFldProgramFile.
<P><LI>Added "Close WarpCenter before Desktop" setting to XShutdown page
in Desktop's settings notebook. This now allows you to tell XWorkplace to
leave the WarpCenter alone, if this lead to scroll bars on the desktop. Hope this helps.

</UL>Miscellaneous changes:
<UL><LI>Moved NLS-independent resources to a separate DLL (XWPRES.DLL).
<P><LI>Added more error checking to "Empty trash" on shutdown.
<P><LI>Reworked WPS command interception for file engines command to avoid
duplicate code... hope I didn't break anything.
<P><LI>Optimized PageMage window procedure to use less PM resources. Also improved
cache locality.
<P><LI>Martin Lafaix contributed some patches for the display of the folder content
menus to make them look more like standard menus. Thanks.
<P><LI>"Object" page is now automatically enabled in XWPSetup when object hotkeys are
enabled. Some people had a hard time finding object hotkeys, Sander. ;-)

</UL>Bugfixes:
<UL><LI>Reworked mutex semaphore protection all over the place. Maybe the WPS
is now less prone to hanging when PMSHELL.EXE is killed.
<P><LI>Reworked NLS initialization. This hung the system when language DLLs failed
to load.
<P><LI>Fixed crashes when archiving displayed a msgbox after an archive was restored.
<P><LI>Fixed two potentially dangerous situations with mutexes and 1) the shared
notebook functions and 2) the worker thread/awake objects registry.
This could have lead to system hangs, and maybe it did somewhere.
<P><LI>Reworked internal timer functions. These stopped working when the date changed.
<P><LI>Fixed crashes in Worker thread when kernel globals were locked.
<P><LI>Added more error checking to internal EA functions.
<P><LI>Changed a USHORT to a ULONG in my internal EXE structures. This _might_ fix
problems with very strange and rare EXE files on the "Modules" page. Thanks, Martin
Lafaix, for pointing this out.
<P><LI>Fixed crashes when favorite or quick-open folders were deleted.
<P><LI>Extended folder sorting was pretty broken. Dunno when these bugs were introduced,
but open folders did _not_ react when global sort settings were changed. This was
a collection of at least three bugs, which are fixed now. Unfortunately, to fix this,
I had to break the folder sort settings in each folder's extended attributes, so you
will lose all your folder sort settings with this release. Sorry.
<P><LI>Extended associations didn't work when a data file had spaces in its full
path. Fixed.
<P><LI>Extended associations ignored program object settings for
"no auto-close after exit" and "minimized". Fixed.
<P><LI>Extended associations did not setup up the program's environment properly
(WP_OBJHANDLE, WORKPLACE__PROCESS), which broke DragText. Thanks, Rich Walsh, for
pointing this out to me.
<P><LI>Extended associations used "plain text" as the standard file type for associations
always, giving all data files the icon for plain text associations... removed that.
<P><LI>"File types" page crashed when a file type was dropped on one of its descendant
file types. Fixed, this is prevented now. Thanks, Martin Lafaix.
<P><LI>On "File types" page, pickup and drop would not work with the context menu. Fixed.
<P><LI>Creating a root file type on the "File types" page led to an error message, even
though the file type was created. Fixed.
<P><LI>Fixed memory leaks with "File types" page. Thanks, Martin Lafaix.
<P><LI>Some "Delete" commands would not be intercepted to go to the trash can if the
command was selected from an object that was not in a folder. Fixed.
<P><LI>Trash can would sometimes display wrong empty/non-empty icon after WPS startup.
Should be fixed now.
<P><LI>On some systems the trash can folder would appear as a template in the "Templates"
folder. Preventing template creation now.
<P><LI>Fixed a memory leak with every time an application was opened via object hotkeys.
<P><LI>XWPString would never save the "Confirm" setting. Fixed.
<P><LI>Extended system sounds broke completely with V0.9.6. Fixed. Duh.
<P><LI>Pages in "Multimedia" hung the system if the object was closed while the
data was still being inserted by the background threads. Fixed.
<P><LI>PageMage has been rewritten in considerable parts.
We are now using a linked list instead of a global array for the internal window list;
wrong sticky windows (newly created ones, Odin and EPM windows) have been fixed;
maximized window handling has been redone.
Dmitry Kubov helped doing all this -- thanks very much, Dmitry.
<P><LI>PageMage "move thread" now has a higher priority. This should fix problems
during desktop switches when other processes hog the CPU.
<P><LI>XShutdown would sometimes crash if "Empty trash" was enabled. Fixed.
