<B>&xwp; 0.9.19 (March 26, 2002)</B>

<P>New features:

<UL><LI>Icon page: Implemented keyboard support for editing the object ID.

<P><LI>NetscapeDDE: uses default browser settings from WPUrl object now,
if not overridden from the command line. Thanks, Yuri Dario.

</UL>Miscellaneous changes:

<UL><LI>Common: Added better error messages for some error codes.

<P><LI>Common: Found a way to give dialog windows a close button too.

<P><LI>Startup: Much more detailed XWPSTART.LOG which might help debugging WPS startup
problems.

<P><LI>&os2; Kernel: Added a couple more SYSLEVEL files.

</UL>Bugfixes:

<UL><LI>Common: Some internal initialization code didn't get called for folders,
which was the reason why renaming them neither refreshed their container record
nor awake shadows properly. Fixed.

<P><LI>Common: Fixed global variables which caused many dialogs to fail after
NLS change. Also localized a few more hard-coded strings.

<P><LI>Programs: Now using XWPDAEMN.EXE for starting programs, which should help
with applications hanging the system.

<P><LI>Programs: Selecting "Cancel" in parameters prompt provoked a cryptic error
message. Fixed.

<P><LI>File operations: True delete replacement never worked if trash can was
disabled. Fixed.

<P><LI>File operations: Title clash dialog no longer appears when creating shadows.

<P><LI>File operations: Trash can crashed when deleting several objects with the
same title. Fixed.

<P><LI>XCenter: Object button and X-button widgets crashed bad when objects from
other processes were dragged over them. Fixed.

<P><LI>XCenter: Double-clicking on clock widget didn't quite open eCSClock correctly.
Fixed.

<P><LI>XWPSetup: "Create object" buttons produced empty titles for some classes. Fixed.

<P><LI>Hook: Pre-populate caused &pgr; to no longer detect the WPS desktop. Fixed.

<P><LI>Hook: Fixed a race which caused &pgr; to ignore the WPS desktop in certain
conditions as well.
