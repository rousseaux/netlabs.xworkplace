If you have the OS/2 multimedia subsystem (MMPM/2) with any sound card installed,
XWorkplace can enhance your system sounds in several ways:

<OL><P><LI><IMG SRC="config_8sounds.gif">
For one, XWorkplace can <B>enhance the "Sound" object itself</B> by replacing
the "Sound" page in that object to allow changing and organizing system sounds
more easily.
<P>In order to use this feature, you need to have the <B>XWPSound</B>
replacement class installed.
<P>The main enhancement to the "Sound" page is the support for <B>"sound schemes",</B>
which IBM half-introduced with OS/2 Warp 4. The main problem with sound schemes was
however that it was nearly impossible to define one's own schemes without messing
with the system INI files directly.
<P>XWorkplace's new "Sound" page has a new interface which allows you to quickly
select a sound scheme, save your current system sounds as a new sound scheme,
and delete existing schemes. I have designed this interface to be similar to that
of Windows 95, which, in this one case, I consider quite well done. Since the
new "Sound" page handles sound schemes already, the original Warp 4 "Sound schemes"
page is no longer displayed.
<P><B>Warp 3 users</B> might be happy to find out that these sound schemes now
work on their operating system too. To be more precise, the "Sound" page lets you
<I>organize</I> your sounds on Warp 3 as well; however, you still won't get sound scheme
support in your Layout Palette
(which, on Warp 4, allows you to specify different sounds for each folder).
<P>Press <B>"Help"</B> on the new "Sound" page to receive more detailed instructions.
<P><B>Note:</B> System sounds are stored in the <CODE>MMPM.INI</CODE> file in
your <CODE>MMOS2</CODE> directory, while sound schemes (for some reason only IBM knows)
are stored in <CODE>OS2SYS.INI</CODE>. I have stuck to this in order not to break
compatibility. As a consequence, however, all users on your system share the same
system sounds and sound schemes, even if you have different Desktops
(and <CODE>OS2.INI</CODE> files) for each user. Sorry, complain at IBM (as if that helped).

<P><LI>XWorkplace continues to support <B>new system sounds</B> as well, as XFolder
versions before V0.9.0 did already. If you enable the "Extended system sounds" in
"XWorkplace Setup", XWorkplace will add new events to the "Sound" page in the
"Sound" object.

<!-- V0.9.3: removed the following
Note: To actually interface MMPM/2 (to play a sound), XWorkplace uses
a separate DLL (SOUND.DLL in the BIN subdirectory of
the XWorkplace installation directory). If you're running into problems with
XWorkplace sound support, you can simply delete that DLL, and the new sounds will
automatically be disabled. If, on the "XWorkplace Status" page in "XWorkplace Setup",
"XSound status" diplays "OK", this means that SOUND.DLL has been
successfully loaded. -->

<P>Please note that the XWorkplace system sounds will make your system slower, just
as the regular system sounds do too. Even on my Pentium-133 with 32 MB RAM, this is
noticeable, even though XWorkplace uses a separate thread to play its sounds.
<P>Configuring these new sounds is not too spectacular: XWorkplace just adds a few more items
to the events list box on the "Sounds" page.
All the XWorkplace items start with "XWorkplace", so you'll be able to view them grouped
together.
<P>
You can find a few small sounds in the <CODE>WAV</CODE> subdirectory of
the XWorkplace installation directory to get you started. <CODE>;-)</CODE>

</OL><B>Implementation.</B> To introduce these features, several components of
XWorkplace are interacting. The WPSound class is replaced with XWPSound to enhance
the "Sound" page. This however does not play any sounds yet; to intercept system
events for the new system sounds, the XFolder and XFldDesktop classes also need
to be installed.

<!-- V0.9.3: removed the following
Third, SOUND.DLL must be present and working
(again, which can be checked in "XWorkplace Setup"). -->

<P>If you want the "Sound" object replacement only, without the new system sounds,
simply disable the "Extended system sounds" setting
on the "Features" page in <A HREF="sys_2global.html">"XWorkplace Setup"</A>.
<P>If you want the new system sounds only, without the "Sound" page replacement,
deinstall the XWPSound class in the "XWorkplace Classes" dialog.
<BR>
