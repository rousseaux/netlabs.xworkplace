<B>&xwp; 0.9.4 (August 9, 2000)</B>

<P>New features:
<UL><LI>&xwp; can now resize some settings pages if the notebook itself is resized.
<P><LI>Added "Keep original title" to folder instance settings notebook.
<P><LI>Added "Initial delay" to startup folder settings notebook. Using sliders for
configuration now.
<P><LI>Added query-setup-strings support for WPProgram.
<P><LI>Added help panels for a number of context menu items which were missing.

<P><LI>Added <A HREF="fldr_60defaultdoc.html">folder default documents.</A>

<P><LI>&xwp; now creates a marker file called "xwparchv.tmp" on the Desktop before
archiving, which is automatically destroyed again after archiving is complete. This
allows for automatic disabling of the archiving functions if an archive was just
restored because then this file exists. This prevents overwriting the most recent
archiving again right after it was restored.

<P><LI>Trash can icons can be changed the <A HREF="065icons.html">normal way</A> now.
Replaced "Icon" page for trash can.
<P><LI>Automatic emptying of trash can before &xshutdown; works now. The setting has
been moved to the "&xshutdown;" settings page in the Desktop's settings notebook and
can be overridden in the shutdown confirmation dialog.
<P><LI>Added "Yes to all" message box button for file operations confirmations.

<P><LI>Added conversion of MB3 clicks to MB1 double-clicks ("Mouse" objects, "Mappings" page 2).
<P><LI>Extended "screen corner objects" to "screen border objects" so you now have eight
objects to be configured (four corners, four borders). You will need to reconfigure your objects
however.
<P><LI>Added <A HREF="pgmg_3sticky.html">PageMage sticky windows</A> settings page
to "Screen" settings object.
<P><LI>PageMage "stay on top" and "flash to top" work now.
<P><LI>Added special PageMage treatment for maximized windows.
<P><LI>Added PageMage to screen border special functions.

</UL>Miscellaneous changes:
<UL><LI>Rearranged some of the help pages which had grown too long.
<P><LI>Gave &xwp; installation folder nice icons, finally.
<P><LI>Reworked exception handlers for XWPDAEMN.EXE.

</UL>Bugfixes:
<UL><LI>Archiving wasn't always disabled if "Archiving" flag was turned off on
replacement "Archives" page. Fixed.

<P><LI>Display of folder hotkey descriptions in context menu could not be disabled
when folder hotkeys were disabled altogether in XWPSetup. Fixed.
<P><LI>"Refresh now" from main context menu didn't refresh container. Fixed.
<P><LI>Fixed separators in WPDataFile context menus.
<P><LI>"Tree view auto-scroll" had a few repaint problems. Fixed.

<P><LI>Clicking "Refresh" on "Object" page doesn't hang WPS any more.
<P><LI>Opening "File" page on SWAPPER.DAT or CHKDSK.LOG doesn't hang WPS any more.
<P><LI>Several settings pages had "to be replaced" group titles. Fixed.

<P><LI>"Create object" menu items in XWPSetup remained active even after objects were
created from those menus. Fixed.

<P><LI>"Replace drive not ready" still didn't work with LAN drives. Another fix attempt.
<P><LI>"Replace file exists" caused dialog to always popup up with WPS "Create another".
Fixed.

<P><LI>Trash can "Destroy" always displayed confirmation, even if turned off.
<P><LI>Trash can didn't recognize drive Z:. Fixed.
<P><LI>Trash can "Drives" page was lacking a help page. Fixed.
<P><LI>Multiple selected drives on trash can "Drives" weren't all moved. Fixed.
<P><LI>Trash can didn't close open subfolders if the parent folder was moved to
the trash can. Fixed.
<P><LI>Trash can allowed objects with OBJSTYLE_NODELETE to be moved to the trash can,
including the Desktop itself. Fixed.
<P><LI>File operations (move to trash, true delete) got confused which objects to
operate on when browsing through several context submenus. There's a bug in the WPS
which removes source emphasis on the first WM_ENDMENU which comes in, even if that
applies to a submenu. &xwp; then thought that source emphasis was set for the
entire folder and worked on that instead. Fixed.
<P><LI>Removed a debugging error message from file operations, which displayed a meaningless
error code.

<P><LI>CDFS.IFS driver dialog: "Optimize" and "Default" buttons didn't work. Fixed. Also added
help page.
<P><LI>CDFS.IFS driver dialog crashed if parameters line was empty. Fixed.
<P><LI>"Backup" and "Undo" buttons didn't work right with new "Mouse" settings pages. Fixed.
<P><LI>Help page was wrong in "Edit function key" dialog. Fixed.

<P><LI>Special treatment of seamless &winos2; windows with sliding focus broke with V0.9.3. Fixed.
<P><LI>Seamless &winos2; menus didn't work right with sliding focus either. Fixed.
<P><LI>Fixed a few quirks with delayed sliding focus because timer wasn't stopped in time.
<P><LI>Sliding menus changed sometimes even if the mouse wasn't moved. Fixed.
<P><LI>Desktop context menu with screen borders always popped up in bottom-left screen corner. Fixed.
<P><LI>VIO windows never showed up in the foreground. This was a strange one. Fixed that.
<P><LI>Fixed hangs of MB3 scrolling over Netscape and PMMail.
<P><LI>MB3 features broke compatibility with other PM hooks. Fixed.
<P><LI>Fixed "window list as mouse pointer" bug with PMMail.

<P><LI>Fixed a large number of bugs with PageMage. Toggling the title bar works now.
PageMage doesn't hang any more when the boot logo transparent windows are used.
PageMage's window position is finally saved.

<P><LI>&xshutdown; finally detects and closes the &warpcenter; properly. This should fix the
"desktop icons move" problem.
<P><LI>&xshutdown; created 0-byte INI files without any warnings.
Somehow my error handling must have broken with 0.9.0.
This still doesn't fix the "save INIs" problem (see the
<A HREF="070faq.html">FAQ section</A>), but at least you get a warning now.

<P><LI>Exception handlers broke again with V0.9.3. Sigh... fixed.

<P><LI>NetscapeDDE failed when other DDE-aware applications were running. Thanks,
Rousseau de Pantalon, for supplying a fix for this.
