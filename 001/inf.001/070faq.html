<!-- This file is all new with V0.81. It combines the (updated) text which were
previously in "vers_3limit.html" and "070tips.html".
<!-- With V0.82, I've spread the questions here across several files because this
was getting too long: those are the new faq*.html files. -->
<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: replace XFolder with &xwp; -->
