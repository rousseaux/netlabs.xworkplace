XWorkplace also implements "screen corner objects", which means that you can configure
the XWorkplace PM hook to automatically open a certain object in its default view if
the mouse pointer is moved to one of the four corners of your screen.

<P>For example, on my system, I have configured this feature to automatically open
the "Drives" folder when I move the mouse pointer to the top-right corner of the
screen.

<P>In addition to opening objects, XWorkplace can also display the PM window list with
this feature.

<P>Like the "sliding focus" feature, this functionality can be influenced on the
new "Movement" page in the "Mouse" object, which usually resides in your "System Setup"
folder.

<P><B>Note:</B> That page is only visible if the XWPMouse class is installed
<I>and</I> the XWorkplace hook has been enabled in
<A HREF="sys_1intro.html">"XWorkplace Setup".</A>
