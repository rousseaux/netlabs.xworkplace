What makes XFolder different from other folder enhancements
is that you can FREELY CONFIGURE
popup menus without having to reboot.
<P>This is done with the use of a separate
<STRONG>Configuration Folder,</STRONG> which looks just like any normal
WPS folder. The installation script placed it on your desktop, but you may move it
anywhere you like.
<P>Whatever you put into this configuration folder will immediately
appear in the context menus of all the
folders on your system.
<P>Let's clarify this by taking a look at the pre-set configuration again:
<P><IMG SRC="menu1.gif">
<P>The pre-set configuration folder looks like this:
<P><IMG SRC="menu2.gif">
<P>As you can see, the folders and program objects in the XFolder Configuration folder
correspond to the items in the context menu.
<P>However, the action which XFolder performs upon selecting a context menu items depends
on the type of object that corresponds to the menu item. You need to differentiate between
the following types of objects:

<OL><LI><STRONG>Program objects</STRONG> will be started when the corresponding menu item
is selected. (Actually, not the program object will be started, but the program defined
in the program object's Settings notebook.)
<P>The four "command line" objects are pretty much copies of the ones that are also installed
by OS/2 itself.
The objects in the <CITE>"Create a~nother"</CITE>
folder all point to
<!-- V0.9.0: change XFolder to XWorkplace -->
<A HREF="080related.html">a little REXX script</A> in the XWorkplace
installation directory, which can create folders and program objects.
<P>XFolder can perform a number of useful tricks on program objects.
Please read through the <A HREF="menu_4wpprogram.html">"Extra features for program objects"</A>
page to learn more.

<BR><LI>Putting <STRONG>another folder</STRONG> in the configuration folder will
create a cascading submenu
in the context menus. In this "subfolder", you can place more objects and folders.
This way, you can create a whole popup menu hierarchy (as can be seen in the default setup above).

<BR><LI>A <STRONG>template or shadow of a template</STRONG> will result in the creation of a
new object from it when the respective menu item is selected. The new object will be created in
the folder whose context menu was used.
<P>For example, if you have created a folder template with
special settings for fonts, colors, etc., you can put a shadow of it into a configuration
folder, and when you select its corresponding menu item from a folder's context menu, a new
folder will be created in this folder, just as if you had dragged a folder from the template.
<P>See <A HREF="menu_2template.html">"Creating objects with XFolder"</A> for more.

<BR><LI><STRONG>All other objects</STRONG> will simply be opened when their corresponding menu
item was selected. This includes shadows of program objects, shadows of folders, "real" files,
shadows of them, and so on.
<P>For example, you can put a shadow of your favorite data file (e.g. "To-do list") into
the context menus. Another example is the shadow of the OS/2 System notebook in the
<!-- V0.9.0: change XFolder to XWorkplace -->
"XWorkplace" submenu, with which you can access the
<!-- V0.9.0: change XFolder to XWorkplace -->
<A HREF="sys_2global.html">XWorkplace Global Settings</A>.

<BR><LI>Starting with version 0.50, you can insert <STRONG>menu separators</STRONG> by putting a program title with the
exact title of <CITE>"---"</CITE> into a configuration folder. See the
<A HREF="menu_4wpprogram.html">next page</A> for
details.

</OL>Note that the <CITE>"~"</CITE>
character within an object's title turns into an underlined character
in the context menu, allowing for keyboard shortcuts.
<P>As simple it may seem, the combined folder/object approach of the
XFolder configuration folder is very powerful. You can add all your favorite programs, templates,
and data files here
which make sense to be executed in any directory.
<P>If you know how to program REXX, you're even better off: you can write your own scripts that
manipulate the WPS, create program objects for them and put these in the configuration folders.
