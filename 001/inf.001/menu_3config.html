<!-- V0.9.0: add the following line -->
<B>Class: XFolder</B><HR>
What makes XFolder different from other folder enhancements
is that you can <I>freely configure</I>
popup menus without having to reboot.

<P>This is done with the use of a separate
<B>Configuration Folder,</B> which looks just like any normal
WPS folder.
<!-- V0.9.1: fixed the following -->
The installation script placed it in the "&xwp;" folder on your Desktop,
but you may move it anywhere you like.

<P>Whatever you put into this configuration folder will immediately
appear in the context menus of all the
folders on your system.

<P>Let's clarify this by taking a look at the pre-set configuration again:

<P>The pre-set configuration folder looks like this:

<!-- V0.9.1: screenshot updated! -->
<P><IMG SRC="menu2.gif">

<P>As you can see, the folders and program objects in the XFolder Configuration folder
correspond to the items in the context menu.
<!-- V0.9.1: added the following phrase -->
So if you add something to the Configuration Folder or remove some object from it, this
will immediately affect all folder context menus.

<P>However, the action which XFolder performs upon selecting a context menu items depends
on the type of object that corresponds to the menu item.

<!-- V0.9.16: removed all the following, instead added this: -->

For details about how this works, please go to the &xwp; installation folder and
select "Help" for the Configuration Folder which you will find there.

<!-- end V0.9.16 -->

<P>As simple it may seem, the combined folder/object approach of the
XFolder configuration folder is very powerful. You can add all your favorite programs, templates,
and data files here
which make sense to be executed in any directory.
<P>If you know how to program REXX, you're even better off: you can write your own scripts that
manipulate the WPS, create program objects for them and put these in the configuration folders.
