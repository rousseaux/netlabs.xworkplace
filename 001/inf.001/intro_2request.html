<!-- this file is all new with V0.83; -->
<!-- changed with V0.85 -->
<!-- Note: I won't recommend to translate this file. The people I'm  -->
<!-- addressing here need to speak English anyway, so don't bother. -->
<!-- Simply copy this most current version over your existing one. -->
<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: replace XFolder with XWorkplace -->
<BODY>
If you like XWorkplace and would like to contribute to it, your support will
be very welcome. XWorkplace is slowly beginning to become too complex to be handled by
one person all alone.

<!-- V0.9.1: removed this:
You don't have to be a programmer to help. Support is appreciated in the
following areas (and others): -->

<UL><LI><B>Translations.</B> XWorkplace is designed to be translateable in a fairly
easy way. All language-dependent parts have been separated from the actual
"intelligence" of the program into separate files, which can be translated independently.
<P>If you're interested in <B>translating XWorkplace to your language,</B>
you can simply download the XWorkplace sources from my homepage, which contain everything
necessary for this.
You don't have to be a programmer to do this, but
it would be of great help if you have a basic knowledge of HTML,
since both XWorkplace's Online Reference and the help
file were originally written in HTML and then simply
converted to the IBM format, which I dislike very much.
<P>In this case, please
contact me, so I can add you to
my mailing list to allow you to get news about changes in time.

<!-- this paragraph removed with V0.85 -->
<!-- Documentation. I am looking for someone to take over maintenance of -->
<!-- the XFolder INF and HLP files. It just takes too much time away from programming to -->
<!-- always have to add documentation while adding new features, and I tend to overlook -->
<!-- stuff sometimes. This applies especially to the German documentation. -->
<!-- So if you know German and/or English and HTML, please -->
<!-- contact me. -->

<P><LI>If you're a programmer and have some experience in <B>PM and/or WPS programming,</B>
please contact me also. We have great plans for XWorkplace's future
<!-- V0.9.1: removed this:
and would like to turn it into more of an "XWorkplace" package -->
to overcome the most obvious WPS limitations
which exist today. Since there's little hope that IBM will do anything about this,
I believe the OS/2 community needs to do it themselves.
The following major things are on the to-do list:
<!-- V0.9.1: removed this : (I am not listing the "little" features
that I'll add myself soon): -->

<BR><OL><LI><B>WPS file handling.</B> This needs some serious reworking. I cannot
believe that the WPS hangs every other time one copies more than a dozen files.
File handling is the main task of an operating system's shell, and the current
implementation needs at least the following enhancements: thread-safety, speed,
proper progress bars when copying, a "Cancel" button that's not always disabled,
more meaningful error messages etc.pp. This will require all of the WPS file-handling
methods to be reworked (<CODE>wpCopy</CODE>, <CODE>wpMove</CODE> etc.).

<P><LI><B>Populating folders.</B> One of the reasons that the WPS
has become so much slower
in Warp 4 is that the WPS now seems to create object handles for
every single file while populating a folder, which wasn't the case with Warp 3.
Object handles are a thoughtful mechanism which is necessary for program objects and
shadows, but they should only be created when necessary. I suspect this misbehavior
is situated in <CODE>wpPopulate</CODE>, which therefore needs some rework too.

<P><LI><B>Icon handling.</B> Drag'n'drop in the WPS always causes icons to be arranged
in a fairly random way. This should be improved.

<P><LI><B>WPProgram.</B> I have never understood why there's an object for global
DOS/Win-OS/2 settings if the program objects don't respect the settings there. We need
support for global settings and also global and individual environment variables
in program objects so that CONFIG.SYS does not always have to be modified.

<P><LI><B>WarpCenter.</B> That thing is instable, slow, and does not conform very well
with the rest of the WPS. This should be completely reprogrammed. Since XWorkplace already
has code for those "folder content" menus, this shouldn't be too hard to to.

<P><LI><B>Multi-user support.</B> The WPS is already designed to support multiple
users thru the use of multiple OS2.INI files and Desktop hierarchies, so I cannot
quite understand why IBM is not implementing this. XWorkplace could do this; I am thinking
of replacing the PROTSHELL and/or RUNWORKPLACE statements in CONFIG.SYS with some
XWorkplace executable,
which will then start PMSHELL.EXE with a bunch of preset environment variables, most
importantly OS2.INI settings and a UNIX-like HOME environment variable to support multiple
configurations for applications in a "home" directory for each user.
XWorkplace should then offer a context menu item to "logoff" or something.

<P><LI>OS/2 also needs to be able to <B>restart Presentation Manager</B> somehow
without having to
reboot, for example to change display resolutions. The current solution is a joke.
If you have any ideas about this, especially how to terminate and restart PM without
blocking the system, please
contact me.

</OL><P>So if you're interested in adding any of these features to XWorkplace
(or if you have other suggestions), you'd be very welcome to join the project!
Any help is appreciated.
