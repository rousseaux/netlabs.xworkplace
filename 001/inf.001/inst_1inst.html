Before installing XFolder, please read the
<A HREF="vers_1compat.html">"Compatibility with other software"</A>
page in the appendices to this reference.
<P>
Starting with V0.9.0, XWorkplace is installed using the WarpIN installer,
a <A HREF="http://www.netlabs.org">Netlabs</A> project by Jens B„ckman and myself.
This finally allows you to install XWorkplace using a graphical interface and
copy the files to a target directory.
<P>
Also, the way National Language Support (NLS) works has been reconsidered.
XWorkplace now per default comes with English NLS. If you wish to install
a different language, download both the XWorkplace base package and a second
NLS package for your favorite language. Install XWorkplace first, then the
NLS package.
<P>
Then restart the WPS.
<P>
After the restart, XFolder will automatically create a
<A HREF="menu_1default.html">default configuration folder</A>.
If you wish to recreate this default configuration, simply delete the existing
configuration folder; as soon as you press the right mouse button on a folder, XFolder
will complain and recreate the default configuration folder.
<P>
XFolder neither changes CONFIG.SYS settings nor does it copy any files into OS/2
system directories. Everything XFolder needs is situated in its own directory. The only
things XFolder needs to work properly are a number of settings in OS2.INI, which will
be removed when you uninstall XFolder.
