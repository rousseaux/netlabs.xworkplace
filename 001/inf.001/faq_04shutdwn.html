<LI><B>Why does automatic reboot not work on my system?</B>
<P>I don't know, on some systems it just doesn't, for
example my Warp 3 with FixPak 35, but it does on my Warp 4. I was unable
to figure out what the reason for this is, but a few users have also reported this, and the
problem also occurs with the WarpEnhancer reboot feature, so I guess it's not &xwp;'s
<!-- V0.9.6: changed the following line -->
fault. (The reboot feature uses an undocumented IOCtl to <CODE>DOS.SYS</CODE> anyway,
so there is probably no guarantee by IBM that it will always work.) If you
have the IBM BootManager installed, you can circumvent this problem by specifying
<CITE>SETBOOT.EXE</CITE> as a user reboot option (Desktop settings notebook -> "XDesktop"
page 1 -> "Actions").

<P><LI><B>Is there anything which &xshutdown; does not properly save?</B>
<P>Yes. &xshutdown; does not save positions of folders which have changed just before
&xshutdown; was initiated, because the WPS <I>delays</I> saving folder positions
in some background
thread to which I have found no access, and the format of the folder position entries
in OS2.INI is not documented, so I cannot do it myself. The same applies to
folders which are closed by &xshutdown; itself. If you want folder positions to
be saved, close them manually and wait a few (about 10-20) seconds before
starting &xshutdown;.
<P>(With "folder positions", I mean the position of an open folder <I>window</I> itself,
not the positions of the icons in a folder. These are properly saved.)
<P>Also, &xshutdown; cannot save changes to the Tasklist window (e.g. fonts or
colors being dropped on them). If you want these changes saved, you'll have to
use &os2;'s regular shutdown just once.

<P><LI><B>Why do I keep getting errors while the INI files are being saved?</B>
<!-- the following added with V0.9.0 -->
<!-- completely rewritten with V0.9.6 -->
<P>This is one of the all time favorites, and the problem has changed with several
releases.
<UL><LI>With early versions <B>before XFolder 0.85,</B> this was mostly due to INI keys
which do not contain any data, which shouldn't happen. This has been fixed a long
while ago.
<P><LI>Still, many people reported these errors to occur pretty randomly, even with
INI keys which <I>do</I> contain data. I was finally able to track this down to occur
with pretty large INI files. I suspect that basically the problem sits in PM itself,
since the <CODE>WinGetLastError</CODE> API
frequently returns <CODE>PMERR_MEMORY_ALLOCATION_ERR</CODE>, which is cooly described
in the PM reference with "An error occurred during memory management.".
I believe that with large INI files, PM runs out of shared memory, which is used for
INI file management. The limit above which the errors start to occur is dependent on
how much shared memory is already used on the respective machine, but it's usually
way above 1 MB per INI file.
<P>Basically, <B>before V0.9.5,</B> &xwp; used PrfOpenProfile to create a
new INI file (for the user and system INI file, respectively)
and then went through all applications and keys in the profile and simply copied them.
This caused quite some stress on the PM shared memory management.
<P>Reducing the size of the INI files did help. By the way, it was not only &xshutdown;
which fails on these INIs, but any other application which copies the user and system
profiles bytewise also (I've checked this with WPSBackup once, which just crashes).
<P>To reduce the size of the INIs, first of all, run CHECKINI (from Henk Kelder's
WPTOOLS package) to have all invalid entries removed.
In addition, use any INI editor to manually delete the following keys
which can grow very large <I>(make a backup of your INIs before doing this):</I>
<UL><LI><CODE>PM_Abstract:Icons</CODE>: this contains the icons for all abstract objects.
By deleting this key, you will lose all user-defined icons for abstract objects, but
in many cases, the data in here is redundant, because e.g. program objects use the
executable's icon per default anyway.
<LI><CODE>PM_Workplace:FolderPos</CODE>: this holds the window positions of all the
folders that were ever opened by the WPS, even if a folder was last opened five years
ago. You will lose all your folder positions when deleting this, but except for maybe
a dozen folders this should be acceptable, and for those, you can quickly resize them
again.
</UL>
<LI>With <B>V0.9.5,</B> I have rewritten the routines so the PM APIs are no longer
used for creating the new profiles. Since Carsten Arnold told me the file format
of the INI files, I wrote a set of routines which write these without using shared
memory. Apparently, this helped. This is the "new method" which is now selectable
on the "&xshutdown;" page in the Desktop's settings notebook.
</UL>
<!-- the following Q added with V0.9.4 -->
<P><LI><B>After using Xhutdown, at the next reboot, the screen is reset to VGA, and
I get a dialog saying that the Desktop could not be found. What is this?</B>

<P>This is the same problem as described in the previous question. Obviously, your INI
files have not been properly saved. As a result, &os2; reverts to default values for
the screen and cannot find your desktop.

<P>If this happens, you will find a backup copy of both OS2.INI and OS2SYS.INI in your
\OS2 directory, renamed to .BAK. Before &xshutdown; saves the INI files, it renames the
old ones. Boot to a command line (using Alt-F1 during startup) and rename these two
backups back to *.INI.
<!-- the following is unchanged -->

<P><LI><B>Why is APM power-off is not working on my system?</B>
<!-- V0.9.13: rewrote this -->
<P>I don't know. On some systems, it just doesn't. I'm pretty sure it's not
&xwp;'s fault because &xwp; does nothing but calling into the
<CODE>APM.SYS</CODE> device driver, after which it has no control over what
that driver is doing to power off the system.
<P>IBM updated the APM APM support with Warp 4 Fixpak 6 (and possibly
later too). The "&xshutdown;" page in the Desktop's settings
notebook displays the version number of the installed APM driver, which should be
at least 1.2 to make APM power-off work.
<P>Even worse, there are many systems which have no 100% compatible APM support
in the BIOS, and this might be the problem too.

<P><LI><B>APM power-off works, but at the next reboot I am getting CHKDSKs.</B>

<P>Again, &xwp; can't do much about this. I am getting these CHKDSKs too on
my laptop, even though it's working fine on my desktop machine.
Apparently <CODE>APM.SYS</CODE> does not wait long enough for some hard disk with
large internal caches to flush their caches to disk before the system power is killed.
This appears to be a generic problem which I've also read about with Win95, so you'll
probably have to disable APM altogether in this case.
