<LI><B>Why does automatic reboot not work on my system?</B>
<P>I don't know, on some systems it just doesn't, for
example my Warp 3 with FixPak 35, but it does on my Warp 4. I was unable
to figure out what the reason for this is, but a few users have also reported this, and the
problem also occurs with the WarpEnhancer reboot feature, so I guess it's not XWorkplace's
fault. (The reboot feature uses an undocumented trick anyway, so there is probably
no guarantee by IBM that it will always work.) If you
have the IBM BootManager installed, you can circumvent this problem by specifying
<CITE>SETBOOT.EXE</CITE> as a user reboot option (Desktop settings notebook -> "XDesktop"
page 1 -> "Actions").

<P><LI><B>Is there anything which XShutdown does not properly save?</B>
<P>Yes. XShutdown does not save positions of folders which have changed just before
XShutdown was initiated, because the WPS <I>delays</I> saving folder positions
in some background
thread to which I have found no access, and the format of the folder position entries
in OS/2.INI is not documented, so I cannot do it myself. The same applies to
folders which are closed by XShutdown itself. If you want folder positions to
be saved, close them manually and wait a few (about 10-20) seconds before
starting XShutdown.
<P>(With "folder positions", I mean the position of an open folder <I>window</I> itself,
not the positions of the icons in a folder. These are properly saved.)
<P>Also, XShutdown cannot save changes to the Tasklist window (e.g. fonts or
colors being dropped on them). If you want these changes saved, you'll have to
use OS/2's regular shutdown just once.

<P><LI><B>Why do I keep getting errors while the INI files are being saved?</B>
<!-- the following added with V0.9.0 -->
<P>With earlier versions, this was mostly due to INI keys which do not contain any data,
which shouldn't happen. Try deleting the offending INI key, since it contains no data
anyway.
<P>Still, many people have reported these errors to occur pretty randomly, even with
INI keys which <I>do</I> contain data. Now that I have two new large hard disk, I
suddenly get these errors too.
<P>I have tried everything to track this error down, and I have come to the conclusion
that these errors must be due to a PM bug, since the <CODE>WinGetLastError</CODE> API
frequently returns PMERR_MEMORY_ALLOCATION_ERR, which is cooly described in the
PM reference with "An error occured during memory management.". Now you explain what
this means...
<P>Anyways, I start getting these errors as soon as my INI files grow to
more than 1 MB in size (each); as soon as I reduce the size of my INIs, XShutdown is
working again. And it's not just XShutdown which fails on these INIs, but any other
application which copies the user and system profiles bytewise also (I've checked this with
WPSBackup once, which just crashes).
<P>So for now, the only thing I can suggest is to reduce the size of the INIs.
First of all, run CHECKINI (from Henk Kelder's WPTOOLS package) to have all invalid
entries removed. Then use any INI editor to manually delete the following keys which
can grow very large <I>(make a backup of your INIs before doing this):</I>
<UL><LI><CODE>PM_Abstract:Icons</CODE>: this contains the icons for all abstract objects.
By deleting this key, you will lose all user-defined icons for abstract objects, but
in many cases, the data in here is redundant, because e.g. program objects use the
executable's icon per default anyway.
<LI><CODE>PM_Workplace:FolderPos</CODE>: this holds the window positions of all the
folders that were ever opened by the WPS, even if a folder was last opened five years
ago. You will lose all your folder positions when deleting this, but except for maybe
a dozen folders this should be acceptable, and for those, you can quickly resize them
again.

</UL>Maybe this helps until I've found another way of dealing with these problems.
For now, I'm helpless myself.

<!-- the following Q&A added with V0.9.4 -->
<P><LI><B>After using Xhutdown, at the next reboot, the screen is reset to VGA, and
I get a dialog saying that the Desktop could not be found. What is this?</B>

<P>This is the same problem as described in the previous question. Obviously, your INI
files have not been properly saved. As a result, OS/2 reverts to default values for
the screen and cannot find your desktop.

<P>If this happens, you will find a backup copy of both OS2.INI and OS2SYS.INI in your
\OS2 directory, renamed to .BAK. Before XShutdown saves the INI files, it renames the
old ones. Boot to a command line (using Alt-F1 during startup) and rename these two
backups back to *.INI.

<!-- the following is unchanged -->
<P><LI><B>Why is APM power-off is not working on my system?</B>
<P>I don't know. My computer does not support APM power-off, so I cannot test this myself.
Please contact ARAKAWA Atsushi, arakaw@ibm.net, who has written the APM code.
<!-- this paragraph nrew with V0.84 -->
<P>Some users have reported that using APM power-off causes a CHKDSK at the next reboot
of OS/2. Apparently, only newer OS/2 kernels have file system functions which support
this features.
IBM has introduced a newer APM support with Warp 4 Fixpak 6, so maybe installing
that fixpak will solve that problem. The "XShutdown" page in the Desktop's settings
notebook displays the version number of the installed APM driver, which should be
at least 1.2 to make APM power-off work.
<!-- this paragraph new with V0.9.0 -->
<P>Finally, I was told that APM does not wait long enough for some hard disk with
large internal caches to flush their caches to disk before the system power is killed.
This appears to be a generic problem which I've also read about with Win95, so you'll
probably have to disable APM altogether, if this is the cause.
