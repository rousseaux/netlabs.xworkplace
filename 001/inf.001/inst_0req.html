<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: replace XFolder with &xwp;, and check notes below -->
<BODY>
&xwp; requires at least <B>OS/2 Warp 3.</B> It will NOT run on previous versions, for it calls
OS/2 API functions not present on OS/2 version 2.x and before.
<!-- the following changed with V0.9.0 -->
<P>Over the years, I have tested XFolder/&xwp; with the following configurations:
<!-- these items changed with V0.82 and V0.9.0 and V0.9.3 -->
<UL><LI>OS/2 Warp 3, no fixpaks installed
<BR><LI>OS/2 Warp 3, fixpak 35 installed
<BR><LI>OS/2 Warp 4, no fixpaks installed
<!-- V0.9.5: changed the following -->
<BR><LI>OS/2 Warp 4, fixpaks 5, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, and 15 installed
<BR><LI>OS/2 Warp Server for e-business ("Aurora"), no fixpaks installed
<!-- V0.9.5: added the following -->
<BR><LI>OS/2 Warp Server for e-business ("Aurora"), fixpak 1 and 2 installed
</UL><!-- V0.9.0: added the following -->
I was reported that installation fails under
<B>Warp 3, fixpak 31.</B>

<!-- V0.9.16: changed all the following -->
<P>&xwp; V0.9.16 has been tested with eComStation 1.0 only, but should work
on Warp 4 as well.
I am no longer testing &xwp; on Warp 3, even though it should work, since no
Warp-4 specific APIs are used.

<P>In general, I strongly recommend installing newer fixpaks. If you're using
Warp 4, I can recommend FP15 with one of the newer testcase kernels, which solves
most of the problems from FP13/14. Or get eComStation.
See the <A HREF="faq_02install.html">FAQ section</A> for details.
