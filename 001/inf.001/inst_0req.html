<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: replace XFolder with XWorkplace, and check notes below -->
<BODY>
XWorkplace requires at least <B>OS/2 Warp 3.</B> It will NOT run on previous versions, for it calls
OS/2 API functions not present on OS/2 version 2.x and before.
<!-- the following changed with V0.9.0 -->
<P>Over time, I have tested XFolder/XWorkplace with the following configurations:
<!-- these items changed with V0.82 and V0.9.0 and V0.9.3 -->
<UL><LI>OS/2 Warp 3 no fixpaks installed
<BR><LI>OS/2 Warp 3, fixpak 35 installed
<BR><LI>OS/2 Warp 4, no fixpaks installed
<BR><LI>OS/2 Warp 4, fixpaks 5 and 7, 10, 11, and 13 installed
<BR><LI>OS/2 Warp Server for e-business ("Aurora"), no fixpaks installed
</UL><!-- V0.9.0: added the following -->
<!-- V0.9.3: changed the following -->
XWorkplace V0.9.3 has been tested with Warp 3 (without fixpaks), Warp 4 (fixpak 13),
and Aurora (no fixpaks).
<P>In general, I strongly recommend installing newer fixpaks. See the
<A HREF="faq_02install.html">FAQ section</A> for details.
<P><B>Note:</B> I was reported that installation fails under
<B>Warp 3, fixpak 31.</B>
In this case, you should install a newer fixpak.
