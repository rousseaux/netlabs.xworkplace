<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: replace XFolder with XWorkplace, and check notes below -->
<BODY>
XWorkplace requires at least <B>OS/2 Warp 3.</B> It will NOT run on previous versions, for it calls
OS/2 API functions not present on OS/2 version 2.x and before.
<!-- the following changed with V0.9.0 -->
<P>Over the years, I have tested XFolder/XWorkplace with the following configurations:
<!-- these items changed with V0.82 and V0.9.0 and V0.9.3 -->
<UL><LI>OS/2 Warp 3, no fixpaks installed
<BR><LI>OS/2 Warp 3, fixpak 35 installed
<BR><LI>OS/2 Warp 4, no fixpaks installed
<!-- V0.9.5: changed the following -->
<BR><LI>OS/2 Warp 4, fixpaks 5, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, and 15 installed
<BR><LI>OS/2 Warp Server for e-business ("Aurora"), no fixpaks installed
<!-- V0.9.5: added the following -->
<BR><LI>OS/2 Warp Server for e-business ("Aurora"), fixpak 1 installed
</UL><!-- V0.9.0: added the following -->
I was reported that installation fails under
<B>Warp 3, fixpak 31.</B>
<!-- V0.9.8: changed all the following -->
<P>XWorkplace V0.9.8 has been tested with Warp 4 (fixpak 15)
and Warp Server for e-Business (fixpak 1). I am no longer testing
XWorkplace on Warp 3, even though it should work.
<P>In general, I strongly recommend installing newer fixpaks. I have found
Warp 4 FP11 to be the most stable, but FP15 seems very useable now too.
See the <A HREF="faq_02install.html">FAQ section</A> for details.
