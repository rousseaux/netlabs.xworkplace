        Additional File-System Object Codes

<!-- This file is all new with V0.84 and contains the status bar codes
     previously described in fldr_32statusbars.html. Nothing else has changed. -->
<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: see notes below -->
<BODY>
<!-- V0.9.0: add the following line -->
<B>Class: XFolder</B><HR>
<B>File-system objects</B> (WPFileSystem class, i.e. folders and data files)
support the following <I>additional</I> codes:
<BR><DL>
<DT><CITE>  $r  1)  </CITE><DD>object's "real name"
<DT><CITE>  $y  1)  </CITE><DD>object type (.TYPE Extended Attribute)
<DT><CITE>  $a  1)  </CITE><DD>object filesystem attributes; this will insert four
characters ("ahrs") for the archived, hidden, read-only and system filesystem attributes,
with the ones capitalized which are set for a file (e.g. "Ahrs")
<DT><CITE>  $D  1)  </CITE><DD>object last write date
<DT><CITE>  $T  1)  </CITE><DD>object last write time
<DT><CITE>  $Eb 1,2)</CITE><DD>Extended Attributes size in bytes

<DT><CITE>  $EK 1,2)</CITE><DD>Extended Attributes size in KBytes, i.e. bytes / 1024
<!-- V0.9.6: added the following two -->
<DT><CITE>  $Ea 1,2)</CITE><DD>Extended Attributes size in bytes/kBytes
(new with V0.9.6); this automatically chooses an optimal scale depending on the number

</DL>
<BR><STRONG>Notes:</STRONG>
<P>1) These codes will only display the data which is held in the internal WPS buffers.
This means when this data changes, e.g. because a file has been altered by some other
program, the status bar information will only change when the WPS buffer data is
refreshed, for example if you select "Refresh now".
<P>2) The WPS has always had a bug due to which an extended attribute size larger than 32767 will
always return 32767, although a size of 64 KB is technically possible.
As a result, XFolder will also display this wrong value.
