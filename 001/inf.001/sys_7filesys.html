File-system caches are a mechanism used by most of today's operating systems to
avoid redundant disk access. In order to accomplish this, a part of the computer's
physical memory (RAM) is used to buffer data that is read from and written to disk.
This memory region is then called a "cache".

<P>Now, if an application accesses disk data that is still residing in the file-system
cache, the operating system does not have to read it from the disk, but can simply take
it out of the cache, which is a lot faster.

<P>On the other hand side, if an application is writing data to disk, OS/2 can
copy this data to the cache first and delay writing it to disk until the disk is
ready for accepting it. This is called "lazy writing".

<P>Do not confuse the file-system caches,
which we are dealing with here, with the other caches that exist on your system, such
as the processor caches and maybe other caches that are built into your hard disks.
These are part of the computer's hardware and not described here.

<P>OS/2 implements different caches for each file system that is installed. This means
that all FAT drives will use one cache, and all HPFS drives a different one. These
caches are separately configured with different CONFIG.SYS settings, which you may
alter
<!-- V0.9.4: changed the following -->
in the "OS/2 Kernel" object. You will find the HPFS settings on the "Drivers" page
in that object, since HPFS is an installable file system (IFS). By contrast, since
FAT is built into the OS/2 Kernel itself, it has a separate page.

<P>Press the <B>"Help"</B> button there to receive a more detailed description of
the different settings.
