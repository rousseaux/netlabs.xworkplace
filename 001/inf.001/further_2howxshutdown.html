<!-- changes with V0.9.0: replace XFolder with XWorkplace -->
<BODY>
The XShutdown feature has cost me a lot of thought, because it is really not documented
anywhere what happens during the normal shutdown process.

<P>OS/2 per default knows two different shutdown APIs:
<UL><LI><CITE>DosShutdown</CITE> only closes all open files, flushes
all file-system buffers und unmounts all file systems; this is what happens
after pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del. No applications are properly closed, and the WPS
is not saved.
<BR><LI><CITE>WinShutdownSystem</CITE> however is the Presentation Manager API
which closes
all windows, saves the WPS and finally calls <CITE>DosShutdown</CITE>.
Just the regular shutdown procedure that you are used to: this is executed when you
select "Shutdown" from the Desktop's context menu or the respective icons from the
Launchpad or WarpCenter.

</UL>Trouble is, there is no function "in between" these two. If you call
<CITE>DosShutdown</CITE> the WPS data is not saved. And if you call
<CITE>WinShutdownSystem</CITE>
you get the regular shutdown without any further chance to interfere. So basically, I
had to recode a complete new <CITE>WinShutdownSystem</CITE>,
which will now be explained. This was quite difficult, since IBM hardly explains
anything about what is really going on during <CITE>WinShutdownSystem</CITE>.

<P>Note: In XWorkplace, the "eXtended Shutdown" and
"Restart WPS" routines share the same code; they
only differ in what happens after all windows have been closed. I will thus use the term
"XShutdown" in the following explanations for both features, unless otherwise stated.

<P>XShutdown is <STRONG>integrated into the WPS</STRONG>
and relies heavily on the XWorkplace class replacements.
I have intentionally not put the XShutdown code into a separate .EXE file for
two reasons: for one, XShutdown needs access to WPS internal data, which is
only available from the SOM context; second, I want to prevent people from
trying to use XShutdown separately, without having the
XWorkplace classes installed, because this could severely damage the Workplace Shell.
In more detail, XShutdown relies on the XFldObject replacement class and the XWorkplace Worker
thread, which cooperatively keep track of the WPS internal data.

<P>To understand what XShutdown is now doing, it is necessary to understand how the
<STRONG>WPS handles its objects</STRONG> internally. Every single
object which becomes relevant to the WPS at some point, be it through populating a folder or
querying its settings or starting a program or whatever, is -- in WPS terminology --
"awakened" by the system, which means that it exists as a SOM object in memory.
<P>The WPS only very rarely puts awake objects back to sleep though,
which would free the associated memory and store the object's data back to disk.
This has two consequences:
<OL><LI>There are always many more awakened objects on your system than
you would actually think, because most of them aren't currently visible.
Even after you close an open folder, the objects therein remain awake; this
speeds up populating the folder when it's opened a second time.
As a result however, the WPS eats up more and more of your memory with each
folder you open.
(If you have turned on the XShutdown log file, you can see how many awake objects
were saved by XShutdown; these are usually several hundred objects, even though
XShutdown doesn't save all awake objects, but only descendants of WPFolder and WPAbstract.
On the "Internals" page in the Desktop's settings notebook you can take a look at how
many objects are currently awake.)
<BR><LI>A change to the object's data sometimes has only an
effect on the SOM object in memory, but is not always saved to disk
or the OS2.INI / OS2SYS.INI files. This is why sometimes the WPS gets into
trouble if you make comprehensive changes, such as
moving a folder containing many abstract objects, and do not shutdown properly:
the physical file data on disk and the WPS records differ then.

</OL>This is what XShutdown needs the <B>XFldObject</B> class for, which
replaces WPObject.
Every time an object is awakened,
the WPS calls several methods (among them <CITE>wpInitData</CITE> and
<CITE>wpObjectReady</CITE>).
XFldObject overrides these and passes the object address in memory
to the Worker thread, which will then
properly update an XWorkplace-internal list of all currently awake objects.
As far as I know, there
is no other way to find out which objects are currently awake; at least
there is no documented API for enumerating them.

<P>Now, when <STRONG>XShutdown is initiated</STRONG> and confirmed, it first starts
two new threads for the following shutdown procedure,
which run parallel to the regular WPS threads: the main <STRONG>"Shutdown thread"</STRONG>
with the message queue for
the status window, and the <STRONG>"Update thread",</STRONG>
which monitors the OS/2 Window List and posts messages to the main shutdown thread,
if the status window needs to be updated.
So closing all currently open windows is a fairly complex
process of interaction between these two threads:
the Shutdown thread closes a window and then
goes to sleep until the Update thread has detected a change in the Window List
(which means that
the window has successfully been closed) and posts a message back to the Shutdown thread,
which then in turn closes
the next window, until all windows are closed.

<P>When all windows are closed, the Update thread exits.
Now the Shutdown thread goes through the
list of currently awake objects (which was described above)
and forces saving their data to the
INI files or to disk by calling each object's <CITE>wpSaveImmediate</CITE>
method. This is only done for WPAbstract and WPFolder descendants, because from
my experience, all other classes save their data synchroneously. (I have tried saving
all WPFileSystem descendants once, and this caused a lot of extended attributes to be
created for every single file that was ever awakened by the WPS.
In addition, shutdown took ages then.)

<P>Finally, depending on what action was desired, the Shutdown thread does one of the
following:

<UL><LI>If you selected <STRONG>"Restart WPS",</STRONG> the Shutdown thread
simply executes <CITE>DosExit(EXIT_PROCESS, 0)</CITE>. Since XWorkplace is part of
the Workplace process, and all parts of the WPS are running in this one process
(the second instance of <CITE>PMSHELL.EXE</CITE>),
this will terminate the whole Workplace Shell. The Shell process
(the first instance of <CITE>PMSHELL.EXE</CITE>) will then restart the WPS
automatically.

<BR><LI>If you selected "Shutdown" and <STRONG>"Reboot afterwards",</STRONG>
XShutdown now also saves the INI files
to disk. This is necessary, because <CITE>DosShutdown,</CITE>
which is called afterwards, does not save them either.
(I guess it's because the INI file API's belong to Presentation Manager.)
Since the PM INI file API's prohibit simply closing the user and system profiles
(which does write their data to disk for all other profiles), XWorkplace copies them
to two temporary profiles, deletes the originals, and then renames the temporary
profiles to the names of the originals.
After <CITE>DosShutdown</CITE>
("Releasing file systems..."), the system is rebooted via a call
to the DOS.SYS device driver.
This feature is documented in <A HREF="http://www.edm2.com/">EDM/2</A> volume 5, issue 9.

<BR><LI>If you selected "Shutdown" and <STRONG>NOT "Reboot afterwards",</STRONG>
after <CITE>DosShutdown,</CITE> XShutdown disables the window list and then
simply blocks the system by calling <CITE>DosEnterCritSec</CITE>
and staying in an infinite loop. Since all file systems are closed, no further
action should
be possible, except for turning off your computer or pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del.
