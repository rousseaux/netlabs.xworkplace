XWorkplace offers you a variety of enhancements to the WPS startup
and shutdown processes. This is explained in detail on the following
pages.
<P><B>Notes:</B>
<OL><LI>All these features are disabled per default and have to
be enabled individually on the "Features" page of the
<A HREF="sys_2global.html">"XWorkplace Setup"</A> object.
In order to implement these features, quite a number of changes had to be made
to some core functions of the Workplace Shell. So if something is not
working right, you can selectively enable/disable each feature.
<P><LI>XWorkplace now has a <B>"Startup panic" dialog</B> which is displayed
if you hold down the <B>"Shift" key</B> while the WPS is starting up.
<P>So if you enable some startup feature and your WPS hangs at startup,
press Ctrl+Alt+Del and hold down the "Shift" key when the system switches
to graphics mode until the dialog appears.
<P>This dialog allows you to temporarily disable certain XWorkplace startup
features and then continue booting. This will not change the XWorkplace global
settings, but only skip certain functions during startup. You can then
change the respective XWorkplace settings after the system has started.
