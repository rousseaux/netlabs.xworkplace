A <B>sticky window</B> is a window that is always visible on all desktops. While
this may seem to be "wasting space", sticky windows can be very useful.

<P>There are some applications which are small in screen space consumption,
such as clocks, resource monitors, program launchers,
which you might prefer to see on all desktops. You can therefore declare them
as sticky in the <A HREF="sys_1intro.html">"Screen" settings object.</A>

<P>There are two windows that are always sticky: the PageMage window itself,
and the Workplace Shell Desktop.
