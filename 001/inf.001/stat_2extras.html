The <B>general appearance</B> of status bars is determined by the first
"Status bars" page in the
in the <A HREF="sys_2global.html">"Workplace Shell"</A> object. You may
switch between four different status bar styles. Just try out which one
you like best; if you change settings there, all
currently visible status bars on your system will
be immediately updated.
<P>You may also drop <B>fonts and colors</B> from the respective palettes
in the OS/2 System Setup
folder. If you drop a font or a color on a status bar, all
currently visible status bars on your system will
be updated. The font and color settings will be saved.
<P>As usual, when dropping colors, holding down the "Ctrl" key will change
the foreground (text) color; otherwise the background color will be changed.
<P>There are two handy <B>mouse features</B> with folder status bars:
<OL><LI>If you <B>double-click</B> on a status bar, the folder's settings
notebook will be opened. (New with V0.84.)
<P><LI>If you click on a status bar with <B>mouse button 2,</B> the folder's
context menu will be opened.
