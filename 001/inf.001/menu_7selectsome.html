XFolder allows you to select only some objects in a folder according to
a typical specification.
<P>This is done by using the "Select by name" menu item, which resides in the "Select"
menu on Warp 3; on Warp 4, this menu item can be found in the "View" menu.
<P>You then get a dialog window where you may enter a file specification such as
<CITE>"*.txt"</CITE> and select or deselect files according to this specification.
<P>Per default, XFolder also defines
<A HREF="fldr_5xelerators.html">Ctrl+S</A> as a
<A HREF="fldr_5xelerators.html">folder hotkey</A> for this function.
