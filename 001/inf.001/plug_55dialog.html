        Step 5: Settings Dialogs
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<!-- This is all new with V0.9.9. -->
<BODY>
Settings dialogs can be displayed by the XCenter to further tune the instance
data of a certain widget. An example of a settings dialog is the "Filter" dialog
displayed by the standard "Window List" widget that comes with XWorkplace.

<P>Using settings dialogs requires a bit more setup. The most important thing
to remember is that the XCenter does <I>not</I> invoke a settings dialog on
an open XCenter widget, but on a <I>setup string</I> only.

<P>This was done so that settings dialogs could be displayed for a widget even
if that widget is not currently visible. With the current implementation, settings
dialogs will only be invoked from the "Properties" menu item of an open widget,
but this will change in the future so it has been isolated from the beginning.

<P>Basically, to support settings dialogs, your widget class must do the following:

<OL><LI>In the widget class definition
(<A HREF="plug_9xcenterwidgetclass.html"><CODE>XCENTERWIDGETCLASS</CODE></A>), set
the <CODE>pShowSettingsDlg</CODE> field to the function in your DLL which can
display the settings dialog.

<P>This function must have the following prototype:

<P><CODE>typedef VOID EXPENTRY ShowSettingsDialog(PWIDGETSETTINGSDLGDATA pData);</CODE>

<P><LI>When the XCenter needs to invoke the settings dialog (e.g. because the "Properties"
menu item was selected), it will call exactly this function, which should do a
standard <CODE>WinDlgBox</CODE> and not return until the dialog has been
dismissed ("OK" or "Cancel" were pressed).

<P>That function receives a pointer to a temporary
<A HREF="plug_9widgetsettingsdlgdata.html"><CODE>WIDGETSETTINGSDLGDATA</CODE></A>
structure, which the XCenter has composed for the settings dialog. In there, the
settings dialog can find out whether the widget is currently visible.

</OL>For details, please look at the "Window list" source code in <CODE>src\widgets</CODE>
in the XWorkplace sources.
