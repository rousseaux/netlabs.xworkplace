With the XWorkplace Global Settings, you can make XWorkplace behave differently.
Here you will find settings which affect XWorkplace in general, such as its language
support, as well as settings which will affect your computer as a whole.
This is why they're called "global settings", as opposed to individual
folder settings, which are explained on a
<A HREF="fldr_7settings.html">separate page</A>.
<!-- V0.9.0: removed several paragraphs -->
<!-- V0.9.0: added the following -->
<P>The major features of XWorkplace can be enabled or disabled in the new
<B>"XWorkplace Setup"</B> object. Depending on the settings on the "Features" page,
certain parts of XWorkplace will be completely disabled. This might be useful
if you are only interested in certain features or if you have problems with others.

<P>The detailed settings for the various XWorkplace features however are in the
<B>"Workplace Shell"</B> object, which you will also find in your "System setup" folder.
<BR><IMG SRC="xfwps.gif">New "Workplace Shell" object
<P>Note that if you disable features in "XWorkplace Setup", some settings pages
in "Workplace Shell" will not be shown if they don't make sense without a feature
being enabled.
<P>
The different settings pages are not explained in detail here. You will find
extensive help by pressing F1 or the "Help" button, which exists on every page.
