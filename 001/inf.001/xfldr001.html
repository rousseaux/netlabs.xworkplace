<!-- This file has changed with V0.83, V0.84, V0.85. -->
<!-- Also, for XWorkplace V0.9.0, the whole damn thing has
     been renamed. Sorry for that, but I need more publicity.
     So, if you have translated the INF file already,
     please go thru _all_ HTML files and search for "XFolder"
     strings. Most of these need to be renamed to "XWorkplace",
     except when XFolder describes the actual XFolder class. -->
This is the XWorkplace User Guide and Reference. This page lists
the major topics of this online book. If you're new to XWorkplace,
you best start reading with the "Introduction" section.
