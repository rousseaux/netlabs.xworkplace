<B>&xwp; 0.9.14 (July 6, 2001)</B>

<P>New features:

<UL><LI>General: Added <A HREF="setupstr_4xfdesktop.html">SHOWRUNDLG setup string</A>.

<P><LI>Treesize: Added "100 largest files" function.

</UL><P>Miscellaneous changes:

<UL><LI>XCenter: Optimized internal timers, which now use less CPU time
(depending on how many widgets are running). Thanks Martin Lafaix for
the oriental meditation hints.

</UL>Bugfixes:

<UL><LI>General: New message boxes never had focus on default button. Fixed.

<P><LI>General: Some message boxes didn't react to mouse clicks at all and could
only be dismissed via keyboard. Fixed.

<P><LI>XFolder: Folder hotkeys for sort and arrange sorted the desktop
even if the respective menu items were disabled for the desktop. Fixed;
these are suppressed now to avoid accidentally sorting or arranging the
desktop.

<P><LI>XFolder: Fixed a number of problems with "Create another" in tree views,
most notably that the new object wouldn't appear unless the tree view had
SHOWALLINTREEVIEW set.

<P><LI>"OS/2 kernel" object: "Syslevels" page never displayed TCP/IP data, fixed.

<P><LI>"Keyboard" object: "Hotkeys" page never used 8.Helv font if enabled. Fixed
by Paul Ratcliffe.

<P><LI>XCenter: If XCenter was on top of screen, menus weren't displayed in
the proper direction. Fixed for object buttons and X-button by Martin Lafaix.

<P><LI>XCenter: MB2 context menu on border or sizing bar broke with 0.9.13. Fixed by
Martin Lafaix.

<P><LI>XCenter: Pulse widget broke with some recent version on some system, causing
crashes. Fixed, hopefully.
