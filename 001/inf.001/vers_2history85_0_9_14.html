<B>&xwp; 0.9.14 (August 26, 2001)</B>

<P>New features:

<UL><LI>General: Added SHOWRUNDLG setup string.

<P><LI>General: Since so many people didn't quite appreciate my beautiful
XWPSTART.LOG file, I added a setting for that on the "Startup" page in the
desktop's settings notebook.

<P><LI>Mouse: Martin Lafaix added a couple of settings to the "Auto-hide mouse"
feature and the general "Auto-move pointer to default push button" feature.
While I was at it, I added mouse pointer animations then.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Added another diskfree widget ("condensed" style).

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Added properties dlg to X-button widget for configuring the
menu items to display.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Added "Hide immediately on mouse click" setting.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Martin Lafaix added dragging widgets to open folders, which will
create a widget definition in a file, which can then be dropped to an &xcenter;
again. Experimental feature, no documentation yet.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Paul Ratcliffe added more options to the "Run" dialog.

<P><LI>Treesize: Added "100 largest files" function.

<P><LI>Status bars: Added "Keys" buttons to status bars page 2 in "Workplace Shell"
to list all the status bar keys that are supported by the corresponding entry field.

</UL><P>Miscellaneous changes:

<UL><LI>General: Greatly sped up dialog engine by caching font data, which affects
the new message boxes, among other things.

<P><LI>XWPSetup: Reworked the "XWorkplace Classes" setup dialog.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Optimized internal timers, which now use less CPU time
(depending on how many widgets are running). As a side effect, they
are even much more precise now.
Thanks Martin Lafaix for the oriental meditation hints.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Added more function imports to widget DLLs to reduce their sizes.

</UL>Bugfixes:

<UL><LI>General: New message boxes never had focus on default button. Besides,
the "snap back" for default buttons on tabbing didn't always work. Fixed.

<P><LI>General: Some message boxes didn't react to mouse clicks at all and could
only be dismissed via keyboard. Fixed.

<P><LI>General: Fixed a rounding problem in the font engine which caused wrong
font sized to be selected in some situations.

<P><LI>General: Fixed about a dozen memory leaks in various places.

<P><LI>General: Library routine which was used for starting applications
(among others, by &xcenter; "Run" dialog)
always hung the system for full-screen &winos2; sessions. Fixed by Paul Ratcliffe.

<P><LI>XFolder: Folder hotkeys for sort and arrange sorted the desktop
even if the respective menu items were disabled for the desktop. Fixed;
these are suppressed now to avoid accidentally sorting or arranging the
desktop.

<P><LI>XFolder: Fixed a number of problems with "Create another" in tree views,
most notably that the new object wouldn't appear unless the tree view had
SHOWALLINTREEVIEW set.

<P><LI>"OS/2 kernel" object: "Syslevels" page never displayed TCP/IP data, fixed.

<P><LI>"Keyboard" object: "Hotkeys" page never used 8.Helv font if enabled. Fixed
by Paul Ratcliffe.

<P><LI>Status bars: "Undo" on status bars page 2 in "Workplace Shell" didn't
undo everything. Fixed.

<P><LI>Hook: This allowed many things during lockup that weren't supposed to
happen, such as opening hot corner objects. Fixed.

<P><LI>PageMage: I added a mutex around a global hook flag which is used by
PageMage to avoid recursing into the hook. It looks like this has improved the
PageMage hangs that occured sporadically when many windows were opened and closed.
I am not sure yet if this completely fixed the problem.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Widget settings management crashed sometimes in an endless loop
when freeing settings data. Fixed by Paul Ratcliffe.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Widget properties dialogs never worked for subwidgets in a tray.
Fixed.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: If &xcenter; was on top of screen, menus weren't displayed in
the proper direction. Fixed for object buttons and X-button by Martin Lafaix.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: MB2 context menu on border or sizing bar broke with 0.9.13. Fixed by
Martin Lafaix.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Pulse widget broke with some recent version on some system, causing
crashes. Fixed, hopefully.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Trays sometimes lost their current tray between restarts. Fixed.
