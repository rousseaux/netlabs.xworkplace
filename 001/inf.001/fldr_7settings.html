While the Global Settings affect all folders at once (hence the name),
some settings may also be changed individually for each folder.
<P>To accomplish this,
XFolder adds a new notebook page to every <STRONG>folder's settings notebook,</STRONG>
 in which you
may override what is specified in the Global Settings. This means, if you configure
a certain setting for a single folder, for this folder the Global Settings have no
further effect.
<!-- xxx -->
<P>In addition, XFolder adds a <STRONG>new notebook page to the Desktop</STRONG> only.
On this page you may configure the Desktop's menu items, the
<A HREF="xsd_1restartwps.html">"Restart Desktop"</A> feature,
and the
<A HREF="xsd_2xshutdown.html">eXtended Shutdown</A>
procedure. By pressing the "Action" button on this page, you may define your own
user reboot actions for the eXtended Shutdown.
<P>All of these settings are throughly explained on several help panels which
appear when you press the "Help" button on one of these pages.
