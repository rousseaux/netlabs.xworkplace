<!-- this file is all new with V0.9.0 -->
Starting with V0.9.0, &xwp; offers you an enhanced interface to the
WPS archiving feature which had been introduced with OS/2 Warp 3. The
new functionality is similar to that of the WPSArcO package and has been
kindly provided by that software's author, Stefan Milcke.
<P>
The new functionality can be <B>configured</B> on the "Archives" page
in the Desktop's settings notebook, which is replaced by &xwp;.
<P>
Basically, instead of just letting you decide whether the WPS should
<I>always</I> be archived at Desktop startup, &xwp; now offers you
much more flexible criteria for whether the WPS should be backed up.
<P>
The archives format itself is not changed. You can therefore still press
Alt+F1 when &os2; is starting to restore your backups. The new features
only deal with <I>whether</I> the WPS should be backed up.
<P>
When the WPS is starting up and &xwp; is thus loaded too, it now checks
the system configuration according to the settings which you have specified.
If it turns out that the WPS needs to be archived according to your settings,
archiving is turned on, the WPS continues booting, and the WPS will then
back up your Desktop.
<P>
You can, for example, specify that the WPS should be backed up every so-and-so days
or based on a certain percentage that the INI files have changed.
<P>
The archiving criteria are described in detail when you press "Help" on the
new "Archives" page in the Desktop's settings notebook.
