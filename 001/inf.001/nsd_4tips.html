<OL><LI>Here's an unintended, but maybe useful side-effect: Since
OS/2 can share its DDE environment with a Win-OS/2 session,
NETSCDDE can even pass URLs to a running <B>Win-OS/2 copy</B>
of Netscape Navigator. This includes Communicator (Netscape 4).
The only thing you have to do is enable WIN_DDE in the
Win-OS/2 session settings of your Windows Netscape program
object. By specifying your Windows Netscape EXE file with
<CITE>-p &lt;exe&gt;</CITE> (see above), NETSCDDE.EXE even provides for proper
WPS integration of Windows Netscapes.

<BR><LI>You can now (V1.1) also specify a <B>.CMD file</B> with <CITE>-p</CITE> and
<CITE>-P</CITE> to have certain commands executed before and after
Netscape is actually started. You should specify the <CITE>-m</CITE> or <CITE>-mh</CITE>
options so that no
ugly VIO window appears. Here is an example <CITE>NETSCAPE.CMD</CITE>:

<PRE>@echo off
rem do some initialization here, e.g. change directory
cd D:\WebStuff
rem now call Netscape
netscape.exe
rem now the .cmd file is put to sleep until Netscape is
rem terminated; subsequent calls to NETSCDDE will contact
rem this running Netscape instance
rem after Netscape is terminated, execute this:
call cleanup.cmd
rem or whatever you want</PRE>

<P>Thanks, Marcus de Geus, for this suggestion.

<BR><LI>Here's a trick from Chris Wenham, senior editor of
<A HREF="http://www.os2ezine.com">OS/2 e-zine</A>,
found in the <B>SmartSuite</B> Mailing List (smartsuite-os2@makelist.com):
<P><CITE>"If you need to
change the web browser that Smartsuite apps call when you click one of
their Internet buttons (like Organizer's button to go to the Almanack
page), or send the URL to the currently running copy of Netscape
instead of launching a new instance, you need to do this:
<P>Launch REGEDIT2.EXE in the /OS2/SYSTEM directory.
Expand the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT tree.
Scroll down to "http" and expand it all the way down (through
"shell" and "open") until you come to "command".
<P>Right click on the data in the "(Default)" key, pick "Modify", and
change the path to the new browser, making sure it's followed with a
"%1" (which represents the URL).
Close RegEdit.
<P>You shouldn't need to reboot, but you might need to restart any SS
components that are running.</CITE>
<P>Chris then states that you can enter NETSCDDE.EXE as your browser in this section.
