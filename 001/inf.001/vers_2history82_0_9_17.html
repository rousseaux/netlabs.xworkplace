<B>&xwp; 0.9.17 (February 4, 2002)</B>

<P>Miscellaneous changes:

<UL><LI>Added setting to XWPSetup "Features" page for whether &xwp; should check
the desktop's integrity on startup, since so many people had problems with it.
Added a corresponding flag to the "Panic" dialog also.

</UL>Bugfixes:

<UL><LI>&xwp;'s "Check desktop" feature would report a broken desktop even if
only a single handle in the file-system handles table was broken. Instead,
&xwp; now gives you a different warning for that, allowing you to display the
"Panic" dialog instead and run xfix from there.

<P><LI>After the dialog that popped up to tell &xwp; about the Desktop's location,
the Desktop would be opened, but the XFldDesktop class replacement would not be
enabled at all. Fixed; all &xwp; features work in that case too.

<P><LI>Programs: Object data was never saved if the program object had no
program data, causing the "---" separators in the config folder to never save
their titles. Fixed.

<P><LI>XCenter: Daemon crashed if "Hide on click" was enabled and hook wasn't active.
Fixed.

<P><LI>XShutdown: Paul Ratcliffe fixed XShutdown to no longer hang with an empty
message box on his system.

<P><LI>xfix: If the handles table was broken, xfix didn't start but only displayed
a cryptic error message. Fixed, hopefully.
