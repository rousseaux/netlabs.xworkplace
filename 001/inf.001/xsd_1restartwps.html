&xwp; can also add a "Restart Desktop" item to the context menu of the Desktop.

<P>After selecting "Restart Desktop", a dialog box similar to the one of the
<A HREF="xsd_2xshutdown.html">Extended Shutdown</A> will appear. The difference is that
after all windows have been closed, not the whole computer is restarted, but only the
Workplace Shell Process (PMSHELL.EXE).

<P>To understand the difference it might be helpful to know that the &os2; user interface is
structured into three "layers", so-to-say, which sit on top of each other:

<BR>The <STRONG>OS/2 Kernel</STRONG> provides the basic functionality of the operating system,
such as device access and multitasking. Without it, nothing would work on your system.

<P>The <STRONG>Presentation Manager (PM)</STRONG> is responsible for the graphics on your system,
such as windows, icons, menus, pictures, and a few more non-graphical things, such as INI files.
&os2; can run text-mode applications (e.g. the &os2; command line, CMD.EXE) without PM,
but all other applications require that PM be running. A typical PM application is Netscape,
for example.

<P>The <STRONG>Workplace Shell (WPS)</STRONG> is just another, however very complex PM
application. It is responsible for displaying folders, starting programs when you
double-click on their icons, associating files to programs, in short: everything you
see after your &os2; has finished booting. This is the context in which &xwp; is running.

<P>The <STRONG>"Restart Desktop"</STRONG> menu item
now terminates the topmost layer of the aforementioned three only,
the Workplace Shell. This takes a lot less time than rebooting your whole computer, because
PM and the Kernel need not be reloaded and initialized.

<P>Restarting the WPS can be helpful when your system has become really slow (for some reason,
at least judging from my personal experience, the WPS eats up more and more memory when you
work with files a lot) or if you have installed software which changes WPS classes.

<P><STRONG>Important notes:</STRONG>

<UL><LI>Please keep in mind that this is not the way
of restarting the Workplace Shell that IBM intended when developing it.
"Restart Desktop" forces the WPS to restart by simply terminating it. Since &xwp;
is part of the WPS process, it can simply exit. &os2; will then restart this process
automatically.
The result is almost the same as if
the WPS had crashed and was restarted, although the WPS data will be saved before restarting.

<BR><LI>On my system, the icons of executables in folders get scrambled after a Desktop restart.
This applies to all program objects and executable files which are not assigned an individual
icon to (via their Settings notebooks). Either icons get completely lost or wrong icons are
displayed. This is a bug in the Presentation Manager,
on which I have no influence. After a complete reboot, the correct icons are restored.

<BR><LI>Neither Presentation Manager nor &cfgsys; settings are re-read upon restarting the WPS.
If these settings have changed, a Desktop restart will not recognize these changes. Reboot instead.

<BR><LI>As a general rule, the more WPS classes you have installed, the more problems
are likely to arise when restarting the WPS. This can be due to many reasons, which I
don't fully understand, but for one certain third-party WPS classes do not seem to
clean up allocated resources properly when the WPS is terminated.
Second, the SOM kernel does
seem to get confused sometimes with WPS class replacements, and some parts of
the WPS then crash about 20 seconds after the Desktop has been populated.
<P>In these cases,
you will be reported fairly random crashes in certain DLLs, which are just symptoms
of something going wrong internally. If this happens, you will have to reboot.
Candidates for these random DLL crashes that I have unveiled are INSTALL.DLL
(contains WPInstall), WPPRINT.DLL (contains the printer and spooler classes), and
also the WorkFrame which comes with the various IBM compilers. (Amusingly, all those
DLLs have been programmed by IBM.)

<BR><LI>Depending on your system, the number of Desktop restarts you may successfully
execute will be limited. Some users have reported that this works only once, on my
system I've successfully restarted the WPS many times (about 30) before the system
crashed. (This sounds like many times, but when programming &xwp;, this is necessary,
unfortunately.)

</UL>You can turn this feature off on a new settings page of the
Desktop's Settings notebook.
