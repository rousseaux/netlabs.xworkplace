While <A HREF="mouse_2sliding.html">"Sliding focus"</A> affects desktop windows,
XWorkplace's "sliding menus" feature affects open menus. This applies to pull-down
menus as well as popup (context) menus.

<P>This feature can be enabled on the "Movement" page in the "Mouse" settings object
as well, if the XWPMouse class is installed and the XWorkplace hook has been enabled in
<A HREF="sys_1intro.html">"XWorkplace Setup".</A>

<P>If this is enabled, the menu selection in an open menu will follow the mouse pointer.

<P>This feature can be configured in several ways. You can choose to have a behavior
as with NPSWPS, that is, the menu behaves as if you held down mouse button 1 all the
time.

<P>However, you can also choose to make menus behave as with Windows 95, if you prefer.
To do this, on the "Movement" page in the "Mouse" settings object, raise the
"Submenu delay" and enable the "Immediate hilite" setting as well.

<P>Detailed help is available if you press the "Help" button on the "Movement" page.
