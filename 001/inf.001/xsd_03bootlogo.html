        WPS Boot Logos

<!-- this file is all new with V0.85 -->

<B>Class: XFldObject</B><HR>
XFolder 0.85 introduced the possibility to display a user-defined bitmap during
WPS bootup. With XWorkplace 0.9.0, a new "Startup" page was introduced to the
Desktop's settings notebook to allow for easy configuration of this feature.
<P>
The boot logo will remain visible until the WPS has completely
initialized itself. It will then disappear and no longer consume
any system resources.
<P>
The <B>"Startup" page in the Desktop's settings notebook</B> allows you to define
the boot logo bitmap and style. More information can be obtained by pressing the
"Help" button on that page.
<P>
I have included three boot logos with XWorkplace:
<UL><LI><CODE>xfolder.bmp</CODE> (which will be used per default)
is a variation of the old XFolder logo. This should still be handled
by weaker systems too.
<LI><CODE>cpuhog.bmp</CODE> is an alternative, new design, which I like
much better, which however might take too long to display on weaker
systems. On my Pentium-133, this one takes about two seconds to display.
<LI><CODE>penguin.bmp</CODE> is new with V0.9.0. This is the well-known Linux penguin
with an OS/2 logo on its belly.
</UL>
When <B>using your own bitmaps,</B> mind these important notes:

<OL><LI>The boot logo
<!-- the following has not changed with V0.9.0 -->
must be an <B>uncompressed OS/2 1.3 bitmap</B> file.
V2.0 bitmaps won't be loaded. I had to include my own bitmap
loading code because at the time of WPS bootup, the WPS's
multimedia classes don't work yet. You can use PMView or the
WPS multimedia classes to convert existing files to 1.3
format.

<P><LI>Transparency is calculated according to the most lower-left
corner pixel of the bitmap. That is, all pixels which have the
same color as pixel (0, 0) will be made transparent.

<P><LI>You should be very careful in replacing these bitmaps. The
transparency calculations are extremely CPU-intensive. If
you use a 500x500 pixel bitmap with half of the pixels
transparent, this can block your system for many minutes.
And I mean <I>block,</I> because most of the calculating time is
consumed by Presentation Manager (PM),
and process kills will usually
hang the whole system.
<!-- V0.9.0: moved the following paragraph up from the bottom;
             rewrote this -->
<P>If everything goes wrong and your WPS won't start any more,
you can <B>hold down the "Shift" key</B> while the WPS is starting up.
This will display the <A HREF="xsd_01intro.html">"Startup panic" dialog</A>, where you
can disable the boot logo and turn it off after the WPS is up.
<P>
Since PM was designed to display rectangular windows only, the
way these "shape" windows are done is that the bitmap is
analyzed pixel by pixel and as many PM subwindows as
rectangular non-transparent areas exist in the bitmap are
created.
<P>
For this reason, be very careful with transparency. The more
non-rectangular transparent areas are in the bitmap, the more
windows have to be created.
<P>
Example:
<PRE>         ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
         ³                    ³
         ³   11111111111111   ³
         ³   11111111111111   ³
         ³   2222      3333   ³
         ³   44444444444444   ³
         ³   44444444444444   ³
         ³                    ³
         ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ</PRE>

(where " " is a transparent pixel) would result in the
creation of exactly four subwindows (marked as "1"-"4").
<P>

However, if you have "diagonal" or other non-rectangular
transparency in your bitmap, one or several subwindows have
to be created <I>for each line</I> of the bitmap, which can really
make PM busy.
<P>

Another example:
<PRE>         ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
         ³                    ³
         ³   111111111        ³
         ³    2222  333       ³
         ³     44     55      ³
         ³      666 777777    ³
         ³       8888888888   ³
         ³        9999999999  ³
         ³                    ³
         ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ</PRE>

This would already create nine windows: one for the top line,
then two each for the following lines, and another one for
each of the bottom lines. So imagine such an image with 500
lines: this would create at least 500 subwindows.
<P>
To make this clear: it's not the parsing of the bitmap which
uses a lot of CPU time. It's the creation of subwindows.
So large bitmaps will not hurt if there's very little or
only rectangular transparency.
<P>
I found this out the hard way when I accidently dithered a
bitmap to the system color palette. Suddenly, there were
hundreds of transparent and non-transparent areas alternating
(because the background which I intended was dithered).
<P>
The bitmap had about 100 lines, and I got several 1000
windows. I pressed Ctrl-Alt-Del after about two minutes.
<P>
So be warned. Start out with small bitmaps and see what your
system can handle. For large bitmaps, try to make the
transparent areas rectangular.
<!-- V0.9.0: added this -->
Do not dither bitmaps, but use plain colors instead.
