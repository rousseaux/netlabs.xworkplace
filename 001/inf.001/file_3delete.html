        Replacing "True Delete"
    </TITLE>

<!-- This is all new with V0.9.3. -->
<BODY>
<B>Classes: XFldObject</B><HR>

Starting with V0.9.3, XWorkplace can replace the regular "delete" mechanism of the
Workplace Shell as well. I call this "true delete", as opposed to moving objects
into the trash can. "True delete" will immediately destroy the objects with no
chance to recover.

<P>"True delete" can be replaced by enabling the respective setting
on the "Features" page in the <A HREF="sys_2global.html">"XWorkplace Setup" object.</A>
This is also initially disabled.

<P>Compared to the WPS's delete operations, XWorkplace's "true delete" has a number
of advantages. For one, you get a proper progress bar which shows you the progress of
the delete operation. Secondly, when you delete a folder with many sub-objects,
you finally get a change to cancel deletion, which isn't possible with the WPS.
I've had this a number of times... pressing the "Delete" key over a folder by
accident, and 100 MB of files got deleted, with no chance to interrupt. Not a good
idea.

<P>If "true delete" is replaced, the following actions will be taken over by
XWorkplace:

<!-- V0.9.7: rewrote the following three paragraphs -->
<UL><LI>If the XWorkplace trash can is enabled, all regular "delete" operations
will still go to the trash can (as described on the
<A HREF="file_2trashcan.html">previous page</A>), so these operations won't be
affected.

<P>This will however affect "true delete" from a context menu (if you hold
down the "Shift" key while clicking on a "Delete" context menu item) and the
"Destroy object" and "Empty trashcan" commands in the trash can itself.

<P><LI>If the XWorkplace trash can is not enabled, this will affect all
WPS delete operations (i.e. every "Delete" context menu item and "Delete"
key press).
