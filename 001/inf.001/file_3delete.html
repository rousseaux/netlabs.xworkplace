        Replacing "True Delete"
    </TITLE>

<!-- This is all new with V0.9.3. -->
<BODY>
<B>Classes: XFldObject</B><HR>

Starting with V0.9.3, XWorkplace can replace the regular "delete" mechanism of the
Workplace Shell as well. I call this "true delete", as opposed to moving objects
into the trash can. "True delete" will immediately destroy the objects with no
chance to recover.

<P>"True delete" can be replaced by enabling the respective setting
on the "Features" page in the <A HREF="sys_2global.html">"XWorkplace Setup" object.</A>
This is also initially disabled.

<P>Compared to the WPS's delete operations, XWorkplace's "true delete" has a number
of advantages. For one, you get a proper progress bar which shows you the progress of
the delete operation. Secondly, when you delete a folder with many sub-objects,
you finally get a change to cancel deletion, which isn't possible with the WPS.
I've had this a number of times... pressing the "Delete" key over a folder by
accident, and 100 MB of files got deleted, with no chance to interrupt. Not a good
idea.

<P>If "true delete" is replaced, the following actions will be taken over by
XWorkplace:

<UL><LI>If the XWorkplace trash can is enabled, all "delete" operations move the
objects into the trash can instead. However, you can still perform an
XWorkplace "true delete" by holding down the "Shift" key while clicking on a
"Delete" context menu item.

<P>Also, in the XWorkplace trash can, "Destroy object" and "Empty trashcan" will be
using the "true delete" routines.

<P><LI>If the XWorkplace trash can is not enabled, this will affect all
delete operations.
