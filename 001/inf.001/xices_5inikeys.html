        XWorkplace INI Keys

<!-- This file is all new with V0.9.0. -->
<BODY>
XWorkplace stores all its global settings in your OS2.INI file. (By contrast,
the settings for individual WPS objects are stored by the WPS, mostly in
the <CODE>.CLASSINFO</CODE> extended attributes.)
<P>This section is supposed to explain the keys in the "XFolder" section
in OS2.INI. The name of that section is purely historical, to preserve
compatibility with older XFolder versions.
<P>Note: XWorkplace does not rely on the INI keys. If you really mess up something
bad, you can simply delete a key with an INI editor or the whole "XFolder"
section altogether. After the next WPS restart, XWorkplace will reinitialize itself
with safe default values.
<P>Here we go:

<DL>
<DT><CODE>Accelerators</CODE>
<DD>This has the list of folder hotkeys. This data is binary, and you should not
change it manually.
This is an array of <CODE>XFLDHOTKEY</CODE> structures,
as defined in <CODE>\shared\common.h</CODE> of the XWorkplace sources.
<B>Defaults:</B> as described on the
<A HREF="fldr_5xelerators.html">"Folder hotkeys"</A> page.

<DT><CODE>AutoClose</CODE>
<DD>The list of items which are to be closed automatically by XShutdown. Each item
on this list is a zero-terminated string, followed by a ULONG which signifies what
to do with this item. Then comes the next item; if it's 0, the list is terminated.

<DT><CODE>BootLogoFile</CODE>
<DD>The fully qualified filename of the
OS/2 V1.3 .BMP file to use for the WPS boot logo, as set by the "Startup"
page in the Desktop's settings notebook. This is a plain zero-terminated string.

<DT><CODE>DialogFont</CODE>
<DD>The font to use for XWorkplace message boxes. This gets set when you drop a font
on one of them.
<B>Default:</B> 9.WarpSans, I think.

<DT><CODE>FavoriteFolders</CODE>
<DD>Well, the list of <A HREF="menu_6favorite.html">favorite folders</A>,
as hex object handles separated by spaces.

<DT><CODE>GlobalSettings</CODE>
<DD>This is a large array of ULONGs with all kinds of settings, mostly from
the "Workplace Shell" object. This corresponds to
the <CODE>GLOBALSETTINGS</CODE> structure
as defined in <CODE>\shared\common.h</CODE> of the XWorkplace sources. You better not
change values in here manually, but you can delete this whole key to reset XWorkplace
to safe default values (after the next WPS startup).
This gets rewritten every time some global setting is
changed in any of the settings objects.

<DT><CODE>JustInstalled</CODE>
<DD>This key only exists right after XWorkplace has been installed and leads to
the "Welcome" information of XWorkplace and the config folder being created.
Afterwards, this key is deleted again.

<DT><CODE>Language</CODE>
<DD>XWorkplace's three-digit language code, from which the NLS to be loaded is
determined. This can be set in "XWorkplace Setup" and
<B>defaults</B> to "001", if not found.

<DT><CODE>NameClashLastFocus</CODE>
<DD>The dialog item ID which last had the focus in the "Object exists" dialog.

<DT><CODE>QuickOpenFolders</CODE>
<DD>The list of <A HREF="fldr_5quickopen.html">quick-open folders</A>,
as hex object handles separated by spaces.

<DT><CODE>RebootTo</CODE>
<DD>A list of user-reboot items (which appear in the "Reboot" drop-down box
in the XShutdown confirmation dialog). This is a list of pairs of zero-terminated
strings: the first one describes the item, the second one specifies the command
to execute. The list is terminated by two extra zero bytes.

<DT><CODE>SB_*</CODE>
<DD>Various status bar settings. The names are pretty self-explanatory, I think.
If a key is not found, a <B>default</B> is loaded from the NLS DLL.

<DT><CODE>SelectSome</CODE>
<DD>The last ten file filters entered in the "Select by name" dialog, each of which is
terminated with a null byte.

<DT><CODE>Version</CODE>
<DD>The XWorkplace version which is running. This only used to be set by the
<CODE>INSTALL.CMD</CODE> file and is not used otherwise.

<DT><CODE>WndPos*</CODE>
<DD>Various window positions to make them reappear where you closed them. These
entries use a plain SWP structure each (I don't use WinStoreWindowPos).

<DT><CODE>XFolderPath</CODE>
<DD>The main directory of where XWorkplace is installed.
This gets set by the install script and is required by TREESIZE.EXE to find
the NLS DLL. The XWorkplace core however does not use this key.

<DT><CODE>XWPSound:LastDir</CODE>
<DD>The "Sound" object replacement remembers the last directory used with
the "Browse" button here.

<DT><CODE>XWPSound:Scheme</CODE>
<DD>The "Sound" object replacement remembers the current sound scheme
name here.
