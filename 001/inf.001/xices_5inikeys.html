        &xwp; INI Keys
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<!-- This file is all new with V0.9.0. -->
<BODY>
&xwp; stores all its global settings in your OS2.INI file. (By contrast,
the settings for individual Desktop objects are stored by the WPS, mostly in
the <CODE>.CLASSINFO</CODE> extended attributes.)
<!-- the following changed with V0.9.1 -->
<P>This section is supposed to explain the keys in the "&xwp;" section
in OS2.INI. If you had XFolder installed previously, &xwp; copies this
data from the "XFolder" section, which remains in OS2.INI so that you can
switch back to XFolder later if you choose to de-install &xwp;.
<P>Note: &xwp; does not rely on the INI keys. If you really mess up something
bad, you can simply delete a key with an INI editor or the whole "XFolder"
section altogether. After the next Desktop restart, &xwp; will reinitialize itself
with safe default values.
<P>Here we go:

<DL>
<DT><CODE>Accelerators</CODE>
<DD>This has the list of folder hotkeys. This data is binary, and you should not
change it manually.
This is an array of <CODE>XFLDHOTKEY</CODE> structures,
as defined in <CODE>\shared\common.h</CODE> of the &xwp; sources.
<B>Defaults:</B> as described on the
<A HREF="fldr_5xelerators.html">"Folder hotkeys"</A> page.

<DT><CODE>AutoClose</CODE>
<DD>The list of items which are to be closed automatically by &xshutdown;. Each item
on this list is a zero-terminated string, followed by a ULONG which signifies what
to do with this item. Then comes the next item; if it's 0, the list is terminated.

<DT><CODE>BootLogoFile</CODE>
<DD>The fully qualified filename of the
OS/2 V1.3 .BMP file to use for the Desktop start logo, as set by the "Startup"
page in the Desktop's settings notebook. This is a plain zero-terminated string.

<DT><CODE>DialogFont</CODE>
<DD>The font to use for &xwp; message boxes. This gets set when you drop a font
on one of them.
<B>Default:</B> 9.WarpSans, I think.

<DT><CODE>FavoriteFolders</CODE>
<DD>Well, the list of <A HREF="menu_6favorite.html">favorite folders</A>,
as hex object handles separated by spaces.

<DT><CODE>GlobalSettings</CODE>
<DD>This is a large array of ULONGs with all kinds of settings, mostly from
the "Workplace Shell" object. This corresponds to
the <CODE>GLOBALSETTINGS</CODE> structure
as defined in <CODE>\shared\common.h</CODE> of the &xwp; sources. You better not
change values in here manually, but you can delete this whole key to reset &xwp;
to safe default values (after the next Desktop startup).
This gets rewritten every time some global setting is
changed in any of the settings objects.

<DT><CODE>JustInstalled</CODE>
<DD>This key only exists right after &xwp; has been installed and leads to
the "Welcome" information of &xwp; and the config folder being created.
Afterwards, this key is deleted again.

<DT><CODE>Language</CODE>
<DD>&xwp;'s three-digit language code, from which the NLS to be loaded is
determined. This can be set in "&xwp; Setup" and
<B>defaults</B> to "001", if not found.

<DT><CODE>NameClashLastFocus</CODE>
<DD>The dialog item ID which last had the focus in the "Object exists" dialog.

<DT><CODE>QuickOpenFolders</CODE>
<DD>The list of <A HREF="fldr_5quickopen.html">quick-open folders</A>,
as hex object handles separated by spaces.

<DT><CODE>RebootTo</CODE>
<DD>A list of user-reboot items (which appear in the "Reboot" drop-down box
in the &xshutdown; confirmation dialog). This is a list of pairs of zero-terminated
strings: the first one describes the item, the second one specifies the command
to execute. The list is terminated by two extra zero bytes.

<DT><CODE>SB_*</CODE>
<DD>Various status bar settings. The names are pretty self-explanatory, I think.
If a key is not found, a <B>default</B> is loaded from the NLS DLL.

<DT><CODE>SelectSome</CODE>
<DD>The last ten file filters entered in the "Select by name" dialog, each of which is
terminated with a null byte.

<!-- the following added with V0.9.1 -->
<DT><CODE>TrashCan::Drives</CODE>
<DD>A binary array of bytes specifying drives support for the &xwp; trash can.

<DT><CODE>Version</CODE>
<DD>The &xwp; version which is running. This is only set for informational
purposes (e.g. for other applications which might be interested), but not read
by &xwp; itself.

<DT><CODE>WndPos*</CODE>
<DD>Various window positions to make them reappear where you closed them. These
entries use a plain SWP structure each (I don't use WinStoreWindowPos).

<DT><CODE>XFolderPath</CODE>
<DD>The main directory of where &xwp; is installed.
This gets set by the install script and is required by TREESIZE.EXE to find
the NLS DLL. The &xwp; core however does not use this key.

<DT><CODE>XWPSound:LastDir</CODE>
<DD>The "Sound" object replacement remembers the last directory used with
the "Browse" button here.

<DT><CODE>XWPSound:Scheme</CODE>
<DD>The "Sound" object replacement remembers the current sound scheme
name here.
