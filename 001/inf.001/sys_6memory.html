Memory management is done by the OS/2 Kernel also. It takes care that processes
may acquire memory, protects processes against each other's memory accesses, and
most importantly manages "virtual memory".

<P><B>"Virtual memory"</B> is the common term for memory which does not exist
physically in a computer, which may however still be allocated by using a
<B>swap file</B> on the hard disk. As a result, an application may use more memory
than what is physically installed in the computer.

<P>If an OS/2 application allocates memory and not enough physical memory is available,
OS/2 takes an area of the main memory (RAM) which is not currently used and stores it
into the swap file on the hard disk. This part of memory is then available and given
to the requesting application.

<P>By contrast, if another application, to which the swapped memory region belongs,
needs the swapped memory again, OS/2 intercepts this memory access (because the
"memory" now resides on the hard disk) and loads that region back into memory
from the hard disk before the application actually accesses it. (If necessary,
OS/2 will have to swap another memory region to the swap file first
to make room for the memory region which is to be loaded back into memory.)

<P>Naturally, a hard disk is much slower than physical RAM: an average hard disk
might have a throughput of 2 to 7 MB per second, while RAM might have a throughput of
20 to several 100 MB per second, depending on your processor speed and on whether that
portion of memory has already been loaded into the processor memory caches.

<P>This is why plenty of RAM is the most important prerequisite for an acceptably
fast OS/2 installation. Even though you may install OS/2 with only 8 MB of RAM
(OS/2 Warp 3 allegedly even with 4), you will then only hear the hard disk rattle
because OS/2 has to permanently swap in and out.

<!-- V0.82: changed 32+40=70 to 72 -- oops! -->
<P>Even if you have a relatively large amount of RAM installed (for example, I have
32 MB), OS/2 will need to swap a lot, depending on how much memory your applications
demand. For example, one complete build of XWorkplace using VisualAge C++ will make my
swap file grow to more than 40 MB, meaning that OS/2 is actually using 32+40 = 72 MB
of memory.

<P>OS/2's memory management, especially the swap file management, may be influenced
by a number of CONFIG.SYS commands. Even though there several of these commands,
I recommend that you only change the <CITE>SWAPPPATH</CITE> command, for which
the "Memory" page in the "OS/2 Kernel" object offers you an interface.

<P>Press the <B>"Help"</B> button there to receive a more detailed description of
the different settings.
