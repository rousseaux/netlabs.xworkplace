<B>Classes: XFldObject, XWPTrashCan, XWPTrashObject</B><HR>
Starting with V0.9.0, XWorkplace introduces a trash can too.
<IMG SRC="file_2trashcan.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT>
<P>
Most people are probably familiar with this feature, because the MacOS, Windows 95 and
KDE (on Linux) offer this feature as well. Basically, the trash can temporarily stores
all the objects that have been deleted on the system, so you can get them back in case
you have accidentally deleted something by opening the trash can (which behaves like
any folder) and restoring an object.

<P><B>Deleting</B> an object into the trash can be done in two ways:
<OL><LI><B>Drag and drop</B> the object(s) onto the trash can icon or into an open
trash can view.
<P><LI>XWorkplace can also manipulate the <B>"Delete" menu</B> item in each object's
context menu so that when you select "Delete", the object will only be moved into
the trash can.
<P><B>Note:</B> For the second option to work, you need to enable this feature
<!-- changed the following link with V0.9.1 -->
on the "Features" page in the <A HREF="sys_2global.html">"XWorkplace Setup" object.</A>
This is disabled per default to avoid confusion.

</OL>Once the objects are in the trash can, you can either have them <B>destroyed</B>
(which will really delete the object) or <B>restored</B> (which will put the object
back to the location where it was deleted from).
<P><IMG SRC="trashcan.gif">

<P>Also, when any objects are in the trash can, the trash can object itself has an
additional menu item called <B>"Empty trash can"</B>, which will delete <I>all</I>
the objects in the trash can for good.

<P>The trash can has a new settings page in its settings notebook, with additional
features. Press <B>"Help"</B> on that page for more information.

<P>If you're interested in details about how the trash can works internally, please
see the <A HREF="further_2howxtrash.html">respective page</A> in the "XWorkplace Internals" section.
