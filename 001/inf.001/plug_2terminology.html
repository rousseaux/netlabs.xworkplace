<BODY>
The following terms are used throughout this documentation, and you
should therefore be familiar with these.

<UL><LI>An <B>"XCenter instance"</B> is an object of the <CODE>XCenter</CODE> WPS
class. There can only be one open view per XCenter so
that an XCenter instance is identical to an XCenter
view when it's open, but there can be several XCenter
instances on the system (i.e. one for each screen border).

<P><LI>A <B>"widget"</B> is a PM subwindow of an open XCenter which
displays something. An open XCenter can contain zero,
one, or many widgets. Every XCenter keeps a list of
widgets together with their settings in its SOM instance
data. This is totally transparent to the widgets, but if
you are interested, you can view that data on the "Widgets" page
of an XCenter's settings notebook.

<P><LI>A <B>"widget class"</B> defines a widget. Basically, it's a
plain C structure
(<A HREF="plug_9xcenterwidgetclass.html"><CODE>XCENTERWIDGETCLASS</CODE></A>)
with the name of a PM window class which is used to create the PM widget windows
(the "widget instances"). Depending on the widget
class's attributes, there can be one or several
instances of a widget class. If you want a different
widget in the XCenter, you need to write a widget class.

<P>A widget class basically boils down to writing a PM
window class (see below), with some additional rules to follow. To
make things easier, several widget classes can share
the same PM class though.

<P>Some widget classes are built into the XCenter itself
(i.e. reside in <CODE>XFLDR.DLL</CODE>), but the XCenter can load
external DLLs too. Several of the widget classes that
come with XWorkplace have been created as plugins to
show you how it's done. If you have the
<A HREF="notices_40source.html">XWorkplace source code</A>,
see the <CODE>src\widgets</CODE> directory.

<P><LI>A <B>"PM window class"</B> is not an XCenter definition... this
is explained in detail in the <I>Presentation Manager Programming Reference.</I>

<P>Basically, PM organizes windows into classes. For example, if you create
a PM button, you invoke <CODE>WinCreateWindow</CODE> with the name of the
button window class (<CODE>WC_BUTTON</CODE>), which is a standard window class
of every OS/2 system.

<P>It is possible to create new window classes though. The XCenter makes use
of this feature to implement widget classes. So again, a widget class is a
PM window class with a bit of extra data to give the XCenter more information
about the widgets that can be created of that class.

<P>When a widget is created (either because it is added to an open XCenter
or when an XCenter is opened in the first place and thus all widgets have to
be created), it does call <CODE>WinCreateWindow</CODE> with the PM window class
name that was specified with the widget class. So this is really not too spectacular.

<P><LI>A <B>"widget plugin DLL"</B> is a separate DLL which resides
in the <CODE>plugins\xcenter</CODE> directory of the XWorkplace
installation directory. This must contain one or
several widget classes. There are a couple of
procedures that a widget plugin DLL is required to
export to make the XCenter see the widget classes.
