The Netscape DDE Interface is configured by using command line parameters. This
is not very intuitive, but flexible. Besides, it means less work for me. ;-)
The command line syntax is (simply double-click on NETSCDDE.EXE for a summary):
<P><CITE>netscdde [-[x|X]n]] [-p &lt;exe&gt;] [-P &lt;params&gt;] [-m[h]] &lt;URL&gt;</CITE>
<P>As you can see, <CITE>&lt;URL&gt;</CITE> is the only required parameter.
<P>The parameters mean the following:
<DL>
<DT><CITE>&lt;URL&gt;  </CITE><DD>a Uniform Resource Locator; you can even open files
on the Internet with NETSCDDE by specifying http://
or ftp:// and such. This is why NETSCDDE also works with URL objects.
For local HTML files, Netscape
tolerates the plain path and file name, so that
a simple C:\docs\text.html will open this file in
Netscape. Example:
<P><CITE>NETSCDDE C:\docs\text.html</CITE>
</DL>
<BR>Options:
<DL>
<DT><CITE>-x      </CITE><DD>If Netscape is not running yet, do NOT open a new
instance of it. NETSCDDE will then simply exit.
<DT><CITE>-X      </CITE><DD>If Netscape is not running yet, DO open a new
instance of it without asking.
<P>If neither <CITE>-x</CITE> nor <CITE>-X</CITE> is specified,
NETSCDDE will prompt you for whether you wish
to open a new instance of Netscape.

<DT><CITE>-n      </CITE><DD>Request a new browser window for &lt;URL&gt; from Netscape,
if it's already running. (If Netscape is not yet
running and a new instance is opened, a new window
will always be opened, of course.) Per default, &lt;URL&gt;
will be opened in the last active Netscape browser
window.

<DT><CITE>-p &lt;exe&gt;</CITE><DD>
Here you can specify the full path of <CITE>NETSCAPE.EXE</CITE>,
if it's not on your PATH. This is only evaluated if
Netscape is not yet running and needs to be started. Per default, NETSCDDE
will search the PATH for NETSCAPE.EXE. Example:
<P><CITE>NETSCDDE -p "C:\NETSCAPE\NETSCAPE.EXE" &lt;URL&gt;</CITE>
<P>The use of quotes is only necessary for paths which
contain spaces, but never hurts.
<P>For an interesting side-effect of this option, check the
<A HREF="nsd_4tips.html">"Tips &amp; Tricks"</A> section.

<DT><CITE>-P &lt;params&gt;</CITE><DD>
Here you can specify command line parameters for
a newly opened instance of Netscape, such as "-3"
for Netscape 3.0 identification (see the Netscape
documentation for details.) Example:
<P><CITE>-P "-3"</CITE>
<P>Again, the use of quotes is only necessary if the
parameter list contains spaces, but never hurts.

<DT><CITE>-m      </CITE><DD>start Netscape minimized.

<DT><CITE>-mh     </CITE><DD>start Netscape minimized and hidden
(see the <A HREF="nsd_4tips.html">"Tips &amp; Tricks"</A> section).
