If you have the OS/2 multimedia subsystem (MMPM/2) with any sound card installed,
XWorkplace can play additional system sounds on certain occasions, just as
older XFolder versions did already.

<P>If you enable the "Extended system sounds" in
"XWorkplace Setup", XWorkplace will add new events to the "Sound" page in the
"Sound" object.

<P>Please note that the XWorkplace system sounds will make your system slower, just
as the regular system sounds do too. Even on my Pentium-133 with 32 MB RAM, this is
noticeable, even though XWorkplace uses a separate thread to play its sounds.

<P>Configuring these new sounds is not too spectacular: XWorkplace just adds a few
more items to the events list box on the "Sounds" page.
All the XWorkplace items start with "XWorkplace", so you'll be able to view them grouped
together.

<P>You can find a few small sounds in the <CODE>WAV</CODE> subdirectory of
the XWorkplace installation directory to get you started. <CODE>;-)</CODE>

<P><B>Implementation.</B> To introduce these features, several components of
XWorkplace are interacting. To intercept system events for the new system sounds,
the XFolder and XFldDesktop classes need to be installed. However, the new
XWPSound class replacement (see the <A HREF="mm_1sndobj.html">previous page</A>)
is not required for the new system sounds. That class only makes configuration easier.
