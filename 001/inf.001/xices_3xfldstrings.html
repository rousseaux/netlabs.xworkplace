        New XFolder Setup Strings

<!-- Note for V0.9.0: Do not change "XFolder" to "XWorkplace" on this page,
     because this deals with the XFolder class only. -->
<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: see notes below -->

<B>Class: XFolder</B><HR>
The following setup strings can be used the same way as the regular folder setup strings
described on the <A HREF="xices_30wpsstrings.html">previous page</A>;
however, they work only when XFolder is properly installed.

<P><CITE><STRONG>ACCELERATORS</STRONG>={YES|NO|DEFAULT}</CITE>
<BR>Sets for an individual folder whether it will respond to folder hotkeys.
This setting corresponds to the one on the "XFolder" notebook settings page.
YES or NO will set this setting for this folder no matter what was specified in the
global settings, while DEFAULT will set this setting to the Global Settings value.
See <A HREF="fldr_5xelerators.html">"Folder hotkeys"</A> for details.

<P><CITE><STRONG>ALWAYSSORT</STRONG>={YES|NO|DEFAULT}</CITE>
<BR>Sets for an individual folder whether it will always maintain its sort order.
As opposed to the <A HREF="xices_30wpsstrings.html">standard WPS folder setup string</A>,
XFolder's new interpretation also accepts "DEFAULT" as a parameter, which will reset
the setting to what you specified on the "Sort" page in the "System" object.

<P><CITE><STRONG>DEFAULTSORT</STRONG>=&lt;crit&gt;</CITE>
<BR>This will set the default sort criterion for an individual folder to something
different from the global sort criterion.
<CITE>&lt;crit&gt;</CITE> may be one of the following:
<BR><CITE>  0    </CITE>sort by name
<BR><CITE>  1    </CITE>sort by type
<BR><CITE>  2    </CITE>sort by object class
<BR><CITE>  3    </CITE>sort by real name
<BR><CITE>  4    </CITE>sort by size
<BR><CITE>  5    </CITE>sort by last write date
<BR><CITE>  6    </CITE>sort by last access date
<BR><CITE>  7    </CITE>sort by creation date
<BR><CITE>  8    </CITE>sort by file name extension
<BR><CITE>  9    </CITE>sort folders first
<BR><CITE>  255  </CITE>reset to global default sort criterion

<P><CITE><STRONG>FAVORITEFOLDER</STRONG>={YES|NO}</CITE>
<BR>Sets for an individual folder whether its contents can be viewed from
all context menus on your system.
Default is NO. There is no global value for this setting.
See <A HREF="menu_6favorite.html">"Folder content functions"</A> for details.

<P><CITE><STRONG>FULLPATH</STRONG>={YES|NO|DEFAULT}</CITE>
<BR>Sets for an individual folder whether its full path will be displayed in its window title.
This setting corresponds to the one on the "XFolder" notebook settings page.
YES or NO will set this setting for this folder no matter what was specified in the
global settings, while DEFAULT will set this setting to the Global Settings value.
See <A HREF="fldr_2fullpath.html">"Full path in window titles"</A> for details.

<P><CITE><STRONG>SNAPTOGRID</STRONG>={YES|NO|DEFAULT|EXEC}</CITE>
<BR>Sets for an individual folder whether the "Snap to grid" item will appear
in the folder's context menu.
This setting corresponds to the one on the "XFolder" notebook settings page.
YES or NO will set this setting for this folder no matter what was specified in the
global settings, while DEFAULT will set this setting to the Global Settings value.
EXEC will execute the "Snap to grid" function on the folder, just as if you had
selected it from the context menu. EXEC is thus no setting, but a command to be performed
on a folder.
See <A HREF="menu_8snaptogrid.html">"Snap to grid"</A> for details.

<P><CITE><STRONG>SORTNOW</STRONG>=&lt;crit&gt;</CITE>
<BR>This will sort all currently open views of an individual folder without changing
a folder's setting (as opposed to <CITE>DEFAULTSORT</CITE>). This is not really a
"setting", but rather a command to be performed on a folder.
<BR><CITE>&lt;crit&gt;</CITE> may be one of the following:
<BR><CITE>  0    </CITE>sort by name
<BR><CITE>  1    </CITE>sort by type
<BR><CITE>  2    </CITE>sort by object class
<BR><CITE>  3    </CITE>sort by real name
<BR><CITE>  4    </CITE>sort by size
<BR><CITE>  5    </CITE>sort by last write date
<BR><CITE>  6    </CITE>sort by last access date
<BR><CITE>  7    </CITE>sort by creation date
<BR><CITE>  8    </CITE>sort by file name extension
<BR><CITE>  9    </CITE>sort folders first
<BR><CITE>  255  </CITE>use default sort criterion

<P><CITE><STRONG>STATUSBAR</STRONG>={YES|NO|DEFAULT}</CITE>
<BR>Sets the visibility state for an individual folder status bar.
This setting corresponds to the one on the "XFolder" notebook settings page.
YES or NO will set this setting for this folder no matter what was specified in the
global settings, while DEFAULT will set this setting to the Global Settings value.
See <A HREF="stat_1intro.html">"Folder status bars"</A> for details.
