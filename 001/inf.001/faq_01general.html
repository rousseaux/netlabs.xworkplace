<!-- This file is all new with V0.82. -->
<!-- Changes for V0.84: see notes below -->
<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: replace XFolder with XWorkplace;
                          also see notes below -->
<BODY>
First of all: look into the <A HREF="sys_2global.html">"Workplace Shell"</A>
object,
where you will find a lot of useful levers to make XWorkplace behave.
<P>If you don't find the answer to your question here, please look at XWorkplace's
<A HREF="notices_3comments.html">web homepage</A> also. I am now
maintaining a public bug list, which might answer your question too.

<OL>
<LI><B>Does XWorkplace slow down the WPS?</B>
<P>I don't think this is true in general. I have not done any tests, but in general,
XWorkplace only slows down <I>certain</I> WPS features, but not the WPS in general.
<!-- V0.9.0: changed the following -->
<P>The most obvious slowdown is opening folder context menus, because the Configuration
Folder has to be read in (including all subfolders) to build the context menu
accordingly.
<P>However, with V0.9.0, XWorkplace now caches the contents of the Configuration Folder
internally, so the contents are only read once, until you modify
the Configuration Folder or one of its subfolders. This should result in some speedup.
Also, with V0.9.0, I have reworked my internal linked-list functions, which should also
result in a speed increase.
<P>With the other functions, I don't know. Naturally, painting the status bars does
take some time, but this is normally not noticeable.
<P>Also, as opposed to some other WPS enhancers, XWorkplace doesn't use excessive
amounts of memory. I have checked this once on my system, and in addition to the
size of the XWorkplace DLLs themselves, XWorkplace only keeps a few 100 KBs of
memory allocated and dynamically frees storage when it's no longer needed.

<P><LI><B>Why are the XWorkplace dialog windows so ugly on Warp 3?</B>
<P>XWorkplace uses the <B>WarpSans</B> font for most of its dialogs, because it's
so much prettier than "System Proportional". This font only
comes with OS/2 Warp 4, so on Warp 3 it's not found, and the system uses the default
system font (System Proportional) instead.
<P>If you can get hold of some Warp 4 <CITE>\OS2\DLL\DSPRES.DLL</CITE> file,
simply copy it over the same file in your Warp 3 \OS2\DLL directory.
This file contains many system resources, among others the
WarpSans font. Warp 3 will work with the Warp 4 version without problems.
(This only works if you boot OS/2 to the command line, using Alt-F1 at startup,
<!-- the following added with V0.9.0 -->
because that DLL gets locked as soon as the system switches to graphics mode.)
<P>Starting with XWorkplace V0.9.0, the "Paranoia" page in "XWorkplace Setup" has
a checkbox where you can force XWorkplace to use the "8.Helv" font in most places.

<P><LI><B>Why are the new system sounds not playing?</B>
<P>You will need to install them first. See the
<A HREF="064intro_sounds.html">corresponding page</A> for more.

<P><LI><B>Why do I keep getting crashes in SOM.DLL?</B>
<P>If you're using <B>VisualAge C++</B> or any other software which installs
SOM runtimes, make sure that
<CITE>SOM.DLL</CITE> is loaded from <CITE>\OS2\DLL</CITE>. This DLL has been updated
with more recent Warp fixpaks. VAC++ puts additional
directories at the beginning of the <CITE>LIBPATH</CITE> statement in CONFIG.SYS,
which still causes the old DLL to be loaded.
Put those directories behind <CITE>\OS2\DLL</CITE> in the <CITE>LIBPATH</CITE>.

<P><LI><B>Why do I get WPS restarts when I change media in removeable drives (MO, ZIP, ...)?</B>
<P>I have no idea. Several people have reported very strange WPS behavior when a drive
folder is opened after removeable media has been exchanged. After that, the WPS works
fine again (until the media is exchanged again).
<P>IBM has introduced some new removeable media support with Warp 4 Fixpak 6, so maybe
we have a problem there. Christian Hennecke &lt;christian.hennecke@ruhr-uni-bochum.de&gt;
wrote in some newsgroup that replacing <CODE>PMWP.DLL</CODE> with a
pre-fixpak 6 version appears to help. You'll also have to install NEWDASD, which should
still be available on Hobbes and Leo.

<P><LI><B>Why do XWorkplace's features only work with some folders and not with others?</B>
<P>This is tricky. Some people have reported this in all variations, i.e.
hotkeys work for the Desktop only, or not in URL folders, or not in Group Folders
(an IBM EWS utility), etc.pp.. The same applies to status bars.
<P>From what I can see, this is related to folder subclassing. XWorkplace needs certain
window messages to introduce these features, and if some other WPS class intercepts
these messages, XWorkplace's features behave funny or cause crashes or do simply not work.
<P>In general, the more WPS class replacements you have installed, the more likely
these errors are likely to appear. With a "clean" WPS, XWorkplace usually works fine, but
the people who have reported these errors sometimes had four folder class replacements
installed, and it's really difficult for me to track down these errors then.
Try to de-install some WPS extensions which you don't absolutely need.
<P>Also, the more messed up your INI files are, the more likely the WPS is going to
become unstable in general. I strongly recommend Henk Kelder's <CITE>WPTOOLS</CITE>
package, which you should run from time to time anyways, to clean up the INI files.
This is still continually updated and available at Hobbes.
<P>I have also found that installation order is important. Some WPS extensions seem
to simply "swallow" messages which they don't need, assuming that they are the only
WPS extension on the system. (This might apply to XWorkplace also, but I have tried to
avoid this.) Now, if XWorkplace comes before this greedy WPS extension in the WPS class
replacement list, which is the case if XWorkplace was installed first, it does get the
message before the other WPS extension.

<P><LI><B>Does XWorkplace cooperate with Object Desktop?</B>
<P>In theory, yes. Practically, sometimes. For details about this (and for other
WPS utilities also), see the separate <A HREF="vers_1compat.html">"Compatibility"</A>
page.

<!-- this item added with V0.84 -->
<P><LI><B>Why do I hear the disk drives running every time I open the "Drives"
folder?</B>
<P>The reason for this is that the XWorkplace status bars query the free space on a
drive. If the first object in your "Drives" folder represents a floppy drive, it's
this drive that's queried.
<P>To avoid this, change the status bar information for
WPDisk objects in the "Workplace Shell" object, page 2 of "Status bars". Then this
information will not be queried.
<P>Alternatively, you can disable status bars for the "Drives" folder only on the
"XFolder" page in the Drives folder's settings notebook.

<P><LI><B>Does XWorkplace run on Macintosh systems?</B>
<P>No.
</OL>

Shameless self-advertisement: XWorkplace cooperates perfectly with
the fantastic <STRONG>CommandPak</STRONG> from the same author, available also at
<A HREF="http://www2.rz.hu-berlin.de/~h0444vnd/os2.htm">my homepage</A>. This package
will improve the OS/2 command line dramatically, among others offering some WPS support
from the command line also.
