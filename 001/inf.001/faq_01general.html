<!-- This file is all new with V0.82. -->
<!-- Changes for V0.84: see notes below -->
<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: replace XFolder with &xwp;;
                          also see notes below -->
<BODY>
First of all: look into the <A HREF="sys_2global.html">"Workplace Shell"</A>
object,
where you will find a lot of useful levers to make &xwp; behave.
<P>If you don't find the answer to your question here, please look at &xwp;'s
<A HREF="notices_3comments.html">web homepage</A> also. I am now
maintaining a public bug list, which might answer your question too.

<OL>
<LI><B>Does &xwp; slow down the WPS?</B>
<P>I don't think this is true in general. I have not done any tests, but in general,
&xwp; only slows down <I>certain</I> WPS features, but not the WPS in general.
<!-- V0.9.0: changed the following -->
<P>The most obvious slowdown is opening folder context menus, because the Configuration
Folder has to be read in (including all subfolders) to build the context menu
accordingly.
<P>However, with V0.9.0, &xwp; now caches the contents of the Configuration Folder
internally, so the contents are only read once, until you modify
the Configuration Folder or one of its subfolders. This should result in some speedup.
Also, with V0.9.0, I have reworked my internal linked-list functions, which should also
result in a speed increase.
<!-- V0.9.13: changed the following -->
<P>As for the other features of &xwp;, it depends. Some things might actually
slow down the system slightly (such as retrieving information for the status bars),
but there are areas where &xwp;'s routines will actually be faster than the
WPS code. For example, if extended file associations are enabled, folder populating
is much faster because &xwp; is using very efficient caching routines for
object handles internally.
<!-- end V0.9.13 -->
<P>Also, as opposed to some other WPS enhancers, &xwp; doesn't use excessive
amounts of memory. I have checked this once on my system, and in addition to the
size of the &xwp; DLLs themselves, &xwp; only keeps a few 100 KBs of
memory allocated and dynamically frees storage when it's no longer needed.

<P><LI><B>Why are the &xwp; dialog windows so ugly on Warp 3?</B>
<P>&xwp; uses the <B>WarpSans</B> font for most of its dialogs, because it's
so much prettier than "System Proportional". This font only
comes with &warp4; and higher, so on Warp 3 it's not found, and the system uses the default
system font (System Proportional) instead.
<P>If you can get hold of some &warp4; <CITE>\OS2\DLL\DSPRES.DLL</CITE> file,
simply copy it over the same file in your Warp 3 \OS2\DLL directory.
This file contains many system resources, among others the
WarpSans font. Warp 3 will work with the Warp 4 version without problems.
(This only works if you boot &os2; to the command line, using Alt-F1 at startup,
<!-- the following added with V0.9.0 -->
because that DLL gets locked as soon as the system switches to graphics mode.)
<P>Starting with &xwp; V0.9.0, the "Paranoia" page in "&xwp; Setup" has
a checkbox where you can force &xwp; to use the "8.Helv" font in most places.

<!-- this item added with V0.82 -->
<P><LI><B>Why are the new system sounds not playing?</B>
<P>You will need to install them first. See the
<!-- V0.9.3: link changed -->
<A HREF="mm_2sounds.html">corresponding page</A> for more.
<!-- V0.9.6: added the following -->
<P>Some people reported that after upgrading their sound cards, &xwp;'s system
sounds no longer works. This turned out to be a problem with the multimedia setup.
Open the standard "Multimedia Configuration" object, "Digital Audio" page, and make
sure that the "WAV" file extension appears in the extensions associations list.

<P><LI><B>Why do I keep getting crashes in SOM.DLL?</B>
<P>If you're using <B>VisualAge C++</B> or any other software which installs
SOM runtimes, make sure that
<CITE>SOM.DLL</CITE> is loaded from <CITE>\OS2\DLL</CITE>. This DLL has been updated
with more recent Warp fixpaks. VAC++ puts additional
directories at the beginning of the <CITE>LIBPATH</CITE> statement in CONFIG.SYS,
which still causes the old DLL to be loaded.
Put those directories behind <CITE>\OS2\DLL</CITE> in the <CITE>LIBPATH</CITE>.

<!-- this item added with V0.9.0 -->
<P><LI><B>Why do I get WPS restarts when I change media in removeable drives (MO, ZIP, ...)?</B>
<P>I have no idea. Several people have reported very strange WPS behavior when a drive
folder is opened after removeable media has been exchanged. After that, the WPS works
fine again (until the media is exchanged again).
<!-- V0.9.6: added this -->
<P>Note that I do not have removeable drives, other than a CD-ROM drive and a CD writer.
I therefore cannot reproduce these problems here. If somebody can take a look at
&xwp;'s source code to find out what might cause this, this would be a great help.

<P>IBM has introduced some new removeable media support with Warp 4 Fixpak 6, so maybe
we have a problem there. Christian Hennecke &lt;christian.hennecke@ruhr-uni-bochum.de&gt;
wrote in some newsgroup that replacing <CODE>PMWP.DLL</CODE> with a
pre-fixpak 6 version appears to help. You'll also have to install NEWDASD, which should
still be available on Hobbes and Leo.

<P><LI><B>Why do &xwp;'s features only work with some folders and not with others?</B>
<P>This is tricky. Some people have reported this in all variations, i.e.
hotkeys work for the Desktop only, or not in URL folders, or not in Group Folders
(an IBM EWS utility), etc.pp.. The same applies to status bars.
<P>From what I can see, this is related to folder subclassing. &xwp; needs certain
window messages to introduce these features, and if some other WPS class intercepts
these messages, &xwp;'s features behave funny or cause crashes or do simply not work.
<P>In general, the more WPS class replacements you have installed, the more likely
these errors are likely to appear. With a "clean" WPS, &xwp; usually works fine, but
the people who have reported these errors sometimes had four folder class replacements
installed, and it's really difficult for me to track down these errors then.
Try to de-install some WPS extensions which you don't absolutely need.
<P>Also, the more messed up your INI files are, the more likely the WPS is going to
become unstable in general. I strongly recommend Henk Kelder's <CITE>WPTOOLS</CITE>
package, which you should run from time to time anyway, to clean up the INI files.
This is still continually updated and available at Hobbes.
<P>I have also found that installation order is important. Some WPS extensions seem
to simply "swallow" messages which they don't need, assuming that they are the only
WPS extension on the system. (This might apply to &xwp; also, but I have tried to
avoid this.) Now, if &xwp; comes before this greedy WPS extension in the WPS class
replacement list, which is the case if &xwp; was installed first, it does get the
message before the other WPS extension.

<P><LI><B>Does &xwp; cooperate with Object Desktop?</B>
<P>In theory, yes. Practically, sometimes. For details about this (and for other
WPS utilities also), see the separate <A HREF="vers_1compat.html">"Compatibility"</A>
page.

<!-- this item added with V0.84 -->
<P><LI><B>Why do I hear the disk drives running every time I open the "Drives"
folder?</B>
<P>The reason for this is that the &xwp; status bars query the free space on a
drive. If the first object in your "Drives" folder represents a floppy drive, it's
this drive that's queried.
<P>To avoid this, change the status bar information for
WPDisk objects in the "Workplace Shell" object, page 2 of "Status bars". Then this
information will not be queried.
<P>Alternatively, you can disable status bars for the "Drives" folder only on the
"XFolder" page in the Drives folder's settings notebook.

<P><LI><B>Does &xwp; run on Macintosh systems?</B>
<P>No.
</OL>

Shameless self-advertisement: &xwp; cooperates perfectly with
the fantastic <STRONG>CommandPak</STRONG> from the same author, available also at
<!-- V0.9.13: replaced link -->
<A HREF="http://www.xworkplace.org">xworkplace.org</A>. This package
will improve the &os2; command line dramatically, among others offering some
WPS support
from the command line also.
