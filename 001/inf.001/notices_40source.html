        &xwp; Source Code
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<!-- this is all new with V0.9.1 -->
<!-- V0.9.4: mostly rewritten -->
<BODY>
&xwp; is an open source project. As opposed to previous XFolder versions,
the source code now entirely resides on the <A HREF="http://www.netlabs.org">OS/2 Netlabs</A>
server.

<P>We use the Concurrent Versioning System (CVS) to cooperatively work on the source
code. Basically this means that there is a common source tree on an Internet server
(in this case, the one of Netlabs) which allows multiple people to work on the sources
at the same time. CVS is then responsible for keeping all the changes in sync.

<P>If you are interested in getting the &xwp; source codes, you can do one of
three things:

<OL><LI>Check the <A HREF="notices_3comments.html">&xwp; homepage</A> for links
to <B>zipped source packages.</B> Every time a new &xwp; version is released, we create a ZIP
file containing the sources from which that version was compiled.

<P>This is probably a good point to start since you don't have to understand how CVS
is working.

<!-- V0.9.7: updated the following -->
<P><LI>If you want to always have the most current sources from the Netlabs CVS server,
you will have to get to know the "Concurrent Versioning System" (CVS).
In your &xwp; installation directory, you will find a file called
<CODE>cvs.txt</CODE> which explains in detail what you need to do.

<!-- V0.9.7: removed all the rest -->
