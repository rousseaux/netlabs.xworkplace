        XWorkplace Source Code

<!-- this is all new with V0.9.1 -->
<BODY>
XWorkplace is an open source project. As opposed to previous XFolder versions,
the source code now entirely resides on the <A HREF="http://www.netlabs.org">Netlabs</A>
server.

<P>We use the Concurrent Versioning System (CVS) to cooperatively work on the source
code. Basically, this means that there is a common source tree on an Internet server
(in this case, the one of Netlabs), and several people commit their sources to that
server.

<P>To get the most current version of the XWorkplace source code, download the
Netlabs Open Source Archive Client (NOSAC) from
<A HREF="http:://www.netlabs.org/nosa">http:://www.netlabs.org/nosa</A>, update
your local "open source archive list" and check out the XWorkplace sources.

<P>The NOSAC has been written by Christian Langanke and comes with extensive
documentation.

<P>In addition, a ZIP of the XWorkplace sources from which this XWorkplace version
was built is available on the WWW page where you downloaded the XWorkplace archive
from.
