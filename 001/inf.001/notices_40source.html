<!-- this is all new with V0.9.1 -->
<!-- V0.9.4: mostly rewritten -->
<BODY>
&xwp; is an open source project. As opposed to previous XFolder versions,
the source code now entirely resides on the <A HREF="http://www.netlabs.org">OS/2 Netlabs</A>
server.

<P>We use the Concurrent Versioning System (CVS) to cooperatively work on the source
code. Basically this means that there is a common source tree on an Internet server
(in this case, the one of Netlabs) which allows multiple people to work on the sources
at the same time. CVS is then responsible for keeping all the changes in sync.

<!-- V1.0.1: replaced all the following -->
At <a href="http://www.xworkplace.org">http://www.xworkplace.org</a>, you will find
instructions where to find the sources, including detailed instructions about how to
use CVS.
