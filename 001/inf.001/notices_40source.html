        XWorkplace Source Code
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<!-- this is all new with V0.9.1 -->
<!-- V0.9.4: mostly rewritten -->
<BODY>
XWorkplace is an open source project. As opposed to previous XFolder versions,
the source code now entirely resides on the <A HREF="http://www.netlabs.org">OS/2 Netlabs</A>
server.

<P>We use the Concurrent Versioning System (CVS) to cooperatively work on the source
code. Basically this means that there is a common source tree on an Internet server
(in this case, the one of Netlabs) which allows multiple people to work on the sources
at the same time. CVS is then responsible for keeping all the changes in sync.

<P>If you are interested in getting the XWorkplace source codes, you can do one of
three things:

<OL><LI>Check the <A HREF="notices_3comments.html">XWorkplace homepage</A> for links
to <B>zipped source packages.</B> Every time a new XWorkplace version is released, we create a ZIP
file containing the sources from which that version was compiled.

<P>This is probably a good point to start since you don't have to understand how CVS
is working.

<P><LI>If you want to always have the most current sources from the Netlabs CVS server,
you will have to get to know CVS. The easiest way to do so is using the
<B>Netlabs Open Source Archive Client (NOSAC).</B> This is a set of REXX scripts written by
Christian Langanke which give you nice WPS objects to access the CVS server and contains
lots of documentation as well.

<P>Do the following:
<OL><LI>Download CVS 1.10 from Hobbes. (Do not use 1.107, it doesn't work.)
<LI>Go to <A HREF="http://www.netlabs.org/nosa">http://www.netlabs.org/nosa</A> to download
NOSAC.
<LI>Once you have installed NOSAC, update your local "open source archive list"
and check out the XWorkplace sources.
</OL>

<P><LI>I personally prefer <B>using CVS from the command line.</B> If you have installed CVS, set
the following environment variables:

<PRE>    SET CVSROOT=:pserver:umoeller@www.netlabs.org:d:/netlabs.src/xworkplace
</PRE>

In addition, you need to set <CODE>HOME</CODE> to your home directory. If you don't have
one yet (which is needed for many UNIX programs), create an empty directory somewhere
and set <CODE>HOME</CODE> to that directory's full path. CVS needs this directory for
creating some configuration files.

<P>Next, create an empty directory which will form the root of all the CVS projects.
This will also be used for downloading other Netlabs projects later.
For example,
create C:\CVS. Then set the <CODE>CVSROOT</CODE> environment variable to that directory,
but use UNIX forward slashes, like this:

<PRE>    SET CVSROOT=C:/CVS</PRE>

<P>In that directory, create a directory called <CODE>xworkplace</CODE> which receives the
XWorkplace sources.

<P>Then you need a CVS password. If you have not
been assigned your own CVS password yet, use <CODE>SET USER=GUEST</CODE>. Then type

<PRE>    cvs login</PRE>

and type <CODE>readonly</CODE> for your password.

<P>To finally retrieve the sources, change to the directory created above (in this example:
<CODE>C:\CVS\xworkplace</CODE>). Then type

<PRE>   cvs checkout .</PRE>

(mind the dot) to retrieve all the sources for the first time.
If you want to update your sources later
(after you have retrieved them for the first time), use <CODE>cvs update</CODE> instead.

<P>If you would like to get write access to the XWorkplace sources for contributions,
please drop a note to <CODE>xworkplace-dev@egroups.com</CODE>, and we'll give you a
write-access password.
