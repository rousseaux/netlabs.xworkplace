The following codes work <B>in all three modes:</B>
<BR><DL>
<DT><CITE>  $c      </CITE><DD>number of currently selected objects
<DT><CITE>  $C      </CITE><DD>total number of objects in folder
<BR><DT><CITE>  $sb     </CITE><DD>total size of selected objects in bytes
<DT><CITE>  $sk     </CITE><DD>total size of selected objects in kBytes, i.e. bytes / 1000
<DT><CITE>  $sK     </CITE><DD>total size of selected objects in KBytes, i.e. bytes / 1024
<DT><CITE>  $sm     </CITE><DD>total size of selected objects in mBytes, i.e. bytes / 1000000
<DT><CITE>  $sM     </CITE><DD>total size of selected objects in MBytes, i.e. bytes / 1048576
<BR><DT><CITE>  $Sb     </CITE><DD>total size of folder content in bytes
<DT><CITE>  $Sk     </CITE><DD>total size of folder content in kBytes, i.e. bytes / 1000
<DT><CITE>  $SK     </CITE><DD>total size of folder content in KBytes, i.e. bytes / 1024
<DT><CITE>  $Sm     </CITE><DD>total size of folder content in mBytes, i.e. bytes / 1000000
<DT><CITE>  $SM     </CITE><DD>total size of folder content in MBytes, i.e. bytes / 1048576
<BR><DT><CITE>  $fb     </CITE><DD>free space on drive in bytes
<DT><CITE>  $fk     </CITE><DD>free space on drive in kBytes, i.e. bytes / 1000
<DT><CITE>  $fK     </CITE><DD>free space on drive in KBytes, i.e. bytes / 1024
<DT><CITE>  $fm     </CITE><DD>free space on drive in mBytes, i.e. bytes / 1000000
<DT><CITE>  $fM     </CITE><DD>free space on drive in MBytes, i.e. bytes / 1048576
<BR><DT><CITE>  $x(xxx) </CITE><DD>Left-oriented tabulator:
print the following information at X position "xxx" (relative to the left border of
the status bar).
<BR>Example: <CITE>$x(300)$sK</CITE> will always print the total size of the selected
objects at X position 300.
<DT><CITE>  $x(-xxx) </CITE><DD>like before, but relative to the right border of
the status bar.
<BR>Example: <CITE>$x(-150)$sK</CITE> will print the total size of the selected objects
at X position 100, if the status bar is currently 250 pixels wide.
<DT><CITE>  $x(xx%) </CITE><DD>like before, but the X position will be calculated
using "xx" as a percentage relative to the current width of the status bar.
<BR>Example: <CITE>$x(50%)$sK</CITE> will always print the total size of the selected
objects in the center of the status bar.
