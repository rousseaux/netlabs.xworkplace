        Updating from a Previous Version of XWorkplace
    </TITLE>

<!-- changes for V0.9.0: see notes below -->
<BODY>
<!-- the following has changed with V0.9.0 -->
XWorkplace V0.9.0 can be installed over old versions of XFolder without any problems.
WarpIN is capable of overwriting files which are currently in use (as the XFolder/XWorkplace
files are by the WPS), so we have no problem there.
<P>
<B>Important notes:</B> A few things change with every XFolder version, sometimes
causing incompatibilities when updating XFolder.

<!-- the following has not changed -->
<OL><LI>Do not be surprised that since V0.60, the "Recreate default configuration"
item has been
removed from the install program. If you wish to
recreate the default configuration folder, simply delete your existing one, and
XFolder will offer you to recreate it.

<BR><LI>Starting with version 0.50, the XFolder Global Settings have been moved into
OS/2's System notebook. Please see <A HREF="sys_2global.html">Global Settings</A>
for details. The "XFolder Global Settings" program (XFSETUP.EXE) which was provided with XFolder
0.4x will have no effect on settings of this version. In other words, you can start it,
but whatever you configure in there will not influence this version of XFolder in any way.

<!-- V0.9.0: remove this paragraph: -->
<!-- Unfortunately, since the internal settings format changes with every new version, -->
<!-- your existing settings will be lost when you're upgrading from a previous version. -->

<BR><LI>Starting with version 0.30, XFolder has changed the
way program objects are handled. The name of the folder whose context menu was used is now
by default sent as an additional parameter to the started application.
<P>If you're updating from XFolder V0.21 and
the applications defined in your existing configuration folder start displaying
error messages, you may need to put an extra <CITE>"%"</CITE>
sign into the parameters list of the corresponding
program object in the configuration folder. See
<A HREF="menu_4wpprogram.html">"Program Objects"</A> for details on this.

</OL>If you experience anything unexpected with your new version of XWorkplace,
please look in the <A HREF="vers_2history.html">"Revision history"</A> section to find
out what has been added to XFolder.
