        Updating from a Previous Version of XWorkplace

<!-- changes for V0.9.0: see notes below -->
<BODY>
<!-- the following has changed with V0.9.0 -->
XWorkplace can be installed over old versions of XFolder without any problems.
WarpIN is capable of overwriting files which are currently in use
(as the XFolder/XWorkplace files are by the WPS), so we have no problem there.

<!-- V0.9.3: remove all the paragraphs except the last... -->

<P>If you experience anything unexpected with your new version of XWorkplace,
please look in the <A HREF="088version.html">"Version information"</A> section to find
out what has been added to XFolder/XWorkplace.

<!-- V0.9.3: added the following-->
<P>Also, it is always a good idea to read the README file which comes with XWorkplace.
You find that in the main XWorkplace installation directory.
