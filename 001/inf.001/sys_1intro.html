<BODY>
<!-- V0.9.0: add the following line -->
<B>Classes: XWPSetup, XFldWPS, XFldSystem, XWPClassList</B>
<HR>
<!-- V0.9.0: rewritten the following paragraph -->
After &xwp; has been installed, you will find a number of new settings
objects in your "System setup" folder. Also, most of the new &xwp; objects
have some new settings pages too. This might seem a bit overwhelming at first,
but I did try to follow a certain logic when implementing all the settings.
<UL>
<!-- the following two paragraphs are new with V0.9.0 -->
<P><LI><IMG SRC="xwsetup.gif"> Starting with V0.9.0, &xwp; introduces a new global settings object called
<B>"&xwp; Setup"</B>. This has a number of settings pages to monitor the status
of some &xwp; internals, globally enable or disable the major &xwp;
features that you might or might not be interested in, and some more troubleshooting
settings.
<P>Those items are explained in detail when you press the "Help" button on those
new settings pages.

<P><LI><IMG SRC="xfwps.gif"> The new <B>"Workplace Shell"</B> object contains those pages
from the old "System" object which deal with the Workplace Shell only. I felt these
are not really "System" settings and deserve a separate object.
<P>&xwp; also adds most
of its own settings pages here, because these mostly affect the Workplace Shell.
This is described in more detail on the
<A HREF="sys_2global.html">"Global Settings"</A> page in this reference.

<!-- V0.9.0: remove this: In this object you will also find the "WPS Classes" page with
which you may manipulate the WPS class list. You will find an introduction to WPS
classes on a separate page -->

<!-- the following paragraph is new with V0.9.0 -->
<P><LI><IMG SRC="xclslist.gif"> There is another new object which contains the <B>"WPS Class List"</B>.
This used to be on a settings page in the "Workplace Shell" object before &xwp;
V0.9.0, but that page proved to be a bit small to get all the information in there.
<!-- V0.9.13: removed link
See <A HREF="sys_4wpsclasses.html">"The WPS Class List"</A> for more information. -->

<P><LI><IMG SRC="xfsys.gif"> The new <B>"&os2; Kernel"</B> object contains those pages from
the old "System" object which deal with &os2;'s internals, e.g. the "Screen" settings.
<P>In this object you'll find several new settings pages to change a number of
settings in the CONFIG.SYS file in the root directory of your boot drive. Since
these settings are a bit hard to remember and since erroneous settings in this file
might even lead to &os2; not booting any more, &xwp; tries to help you by setting
this up automatically.
<P>On each of these new settings pages, which will be explained in more detail
on the following pages, you will find a button called "Update CONFIG.SYS" instead
of the usual "Undo" and "Default" buttons. Pressing this button will cause the
CONFIG.SYS file to be rewritten according to the settings you've changed.

<P>The different settings are explained in great detail if you press the
<B>"Help"</B> button on one of the settings pages.

<!-- V0.9.13: removed all this
Please read the following pages to obtain a general
introduction of what these settings do with certain parts of the &os2; kernel:
A HREF="sys_5scheduler.html"The &os2; Scheduler
sys_6memory.html" &os2; memory management
 File-system caches
-->

<!-- V0.9.3: added the following list point and the image -->
<P><LI><IMG SRC="xwpscreen.gif"> The <B>"Screen"</B> settings object is new with V0.9.3
and holds those settings pages from the old "System" object which deal with the screen.
In addition, if you have <A HREF="06342intro_pagemage.html">PageMage</A> enabled,
several settings pages are inserted here as well to configure PageMage.

</UL>The <B>old "System" object</B> continues to work,
in case other WPS enhancers try to
insert anything into this object. Such extensions will also appear in the new
"&os2; Kernel" object, which inherits the "System" characteristics.
<P>Please note that you should not open the old "System" object and one of the new
objects together to change settings. The settings pages are not prepared for this, and
this might mess up the WPS settings.
<!-- the following added with V0.9.0 -->
<P>Additional settings pages can be found in the settings notebooks of each folder,
the Desktop, the <A HREF="xsd_3folders.html">&xwp; startup folder</A>,
and the <A HREF="file_2trashcan.html">&xwp; trash can</A>.
