<B>XWorkplace 0.9.5 (October 7, 2000)</B>

<P>New features:
<UL><LI>New XWorkplace logo.
<P><LI>Added "Dereference shadows" setting to status bars page 2 even when
multiple objects are selected.
<P><LI>Added HPFS386 driver configuration dialog.
<P><LI>Added flags for APM power-off to <A HREF="xsd_4cmdline.html">XSHUTDWN.EXE</A>.

</UL>Miscellaneous changes:
<UL><LI>File operations confirmation windows now use folders as owner windows.
<P><LI>Added "Set" button to object hotkeys entry field.
<P><LI>Added a few more help panels.
<P><LI>Went back to the V0.9.3 code for closing the WarpCenter during shutdown.

</UL>Bugfixes:
<UL><LI>XWorkplace Installation folder got deleted on every install, leading to
an empty folder on updates. Fixed.
<P><LI>XWPMedia checkbox did nothing in "XWorkplace classes" dialog (XWPSetup). Fixed.
<P><LI>"Screen" settings notebook was too small when first opened. Fixed.
<P><LI>Object setup strings always displayed DEFAULTVIEW=xxx, even if the class's default
view wasn't changed. Fixed. Also added DEFAULTVIEW=RUNNING.
<P><LI>Disk objects had "Create another" menu item. Removed that.
<P><LI>WPCommandFile had "Module" page inherited from XFldProgramFile. Removed that.
<P><LI>Fixed progress bar text painting, which was too high with some resolutions.
<P><LI>Status bars for WPSharedDir were wrong. Fixed by Paul Ratcliffe.

<P><LI>Open "WPS class list" got solidly confused when Alt+F4 was pressed. Fixed.
<P><LI>Orphaned classes in "WPS class list" always had "Deregister" disabled. Fixed.
<P><LI>Class list view had "~" character in title. Fixed.

<P><LI>Dragging trash objects out of the trash can made them undeleteable. Fixed.
One of those awful WPS d'n'd problems.
<P><LI>Trash can status bars always used "." as a thousands separator. Fixed; this
respects the "Country" settings now.
<P><LI>Trash can never deleted empty hidden "\trash" directories. Fixed.

<P><LI>Object hotkeys didn't work after fresh install. Fixed.
<P><LI>Sliding focus was always half on, even if disabled, leading to deactivated
windows everywhere. Fixed.
<P><LI>Paul Ratcliffe fixed a couple more bugs related to sliding focus and auto-hide mouse.

<P><LI>WPS frequently hung after WPS restart with FP13/14 and WSeB. Attempted a fix.
<P><LI>You have now three options for XShutdown's "save INIs" behavior. Added my own
save-INI routines which should solve the problems which have existed for more than
two years now. Thanks, Carsten Arnold, for telling me about the .INI file format.
