<B>&xwp; 0.9.16 (September 19, 2001)</B>

<P>New features:

<UL><LI>File types: Added icon display to "File types" page in "Workplace Shell".
Also added "Properties" and "Open folder" items to association context menu.

<P><LI>Netscape DDE: Added more command line options for specifying the
DDE server name and the startup directory, which can make NetscDDE work with
Mozilla too. Also removed the dull dialog explaining the command line options
and added a proper help panel (shows up if you double-click on NETSCDDE.EXE only).

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Pulse widget now opens "OS/2 Kernel" object on double-click.

<P><LI>xfix: Added object IDs display and deletion.

</UL>Miscellaneous changes:

<UL><LI>Moved more pages from the INF to the HLP file, such as
<A HREF="xices_30wpsstrings.html">setup strings</A>.
In addition, WPProgram setup strings are now documented also.

<P><LI>Changed the settings format for the WPS extended archiving. Please
reconfigure.

</UL>Bugfixes:

<UL><LI>Common: Run dialog would diplay the full path of directories too,
e.g. if "install" was entered. Fixed; directories are now properly ignored.

<P><LI>Status bars: For remote disk objects (WPSharedDir), the status bars kept
querying drive A: for the free space, which was kind of annoying. The reason was
that WPShared::wpQueryLogicalDrive returns 1 always for some reason only IBM can
explain. Added a special case check in a couple of places.

<P><LI>XCenter: Battery widget didn't repaint its background properly when
the power icon was changed. Fixed.

<P><LI>PageMage: &xcenter;s are now sticky always and do not have to be added manually
to the "Stickies" list any more.
