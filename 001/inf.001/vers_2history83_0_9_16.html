<B>&xwp; 0.9.16 (September 19, 2001)</B>

<P>New features:

<UL><LI>Common: Instead of adding the "Object" page, &xwp; now completely
replaces the "Icon" page in every settings notebook.

<P><LI>File types: Added icon display to "File types" page in "Workplace Shell".
Also added "Properties" and "Open folder" items to association context menu.

<P><LI>Netscape DDE: Added more command line options for specifying the
DDE server name and the startup directory, which can make NetscDDE work with
Mozilla too. Also removed the dull dialog explaining the command line options
and added a proper help panel (shows up if you double-click on NETSCDDE.EXE only).

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Pulse widget now opens "OS/2 Kernel" object on double-click.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: When &xcenter; is newly created, it comes up with a standard
widget setup now. The empty bar confused many people initially.

<P><LI>xfix: Added object IDs display and deletion.

</UL>Miscellaneous changes:

<UL><LI>Common: Moved more pages from the INF to the HLP file, such as
<A HREF="xices_30wpsstrings.html">setup strings</A>.
In addition, WPProgram setup strings are now documented also.

<P><LI>Common: Reworked many settings pages to use my dialog formatter now. This makes
changes much easier and saves everyone from using the stupid DLGEDIT any more.

<P><LI>Common: Rework of the query-setup-string interfaces to be less CPU-intensive.
Also got rid of the danger of synchronization problems between the two calls
to xwpQuerySetup that were always required.

<P><LI>Common: Rewrote TMF loader to be much faster now. XWorkplace now keeps its TMF
file open all the time and thus doesn't have to rebuild the strings buffer
for every message that is needed.

<P><LI>Archiving: Changed the settings format for the WPS extended archiving. Please
reconfigure.

<P><LI>Font folder: Per popular request, the font sample display now displays fonts with
the smallest sizes on top.

<P><LI>Status bars: are now respecting the default font setting on the "Paranoia" page
and using WarpSans by default.

</UL>Bugfixes:

<UL><LI>Common: Run dialog would diplay the full path of directories too,
e.g. if "install" was entered. Fixed; directories are now properly ignored.

<P><LI>Common: Rewrote the routine that loaded objects lists from OS2.INI. This
might fix the problem with endlessly looping startup folders that people were
experiencing.

<P><LI>Common: Fixed several small memory leaks in various places.

<P><LI>Status bars: For remote disk objects (WPSharedDir), the status bars kept
querying drive A: for the free space, which was kind of annoying. The reason was
that WPShared::wpQueryLogicalDrive returns 1 always for some reason only IBM can
explain. Added a special case check in a couple of places.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Fixed the 100% CPU load problem when mouse was over &xcenter; while
a settings dialog was showing.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Battery widget didn't repaint its background properly when
the power icon was changed. Fixed.

<P><LI>PageMage: &xcenter;s are now sticky always and do not have to be added manually
to the "Stickies" list any more.
