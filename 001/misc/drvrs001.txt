 * drvrs001.txt:
 *      driver specifications for the "Drivers" page in
 *      the "OS/2 Kernel" object, English version (001).
 *
 *      This file uses a syntax similar to the C language,
 *      but not quite the same. This gets parsed by
 *      XWorkplace when the "Drivers" page is selected.
 *
 *      Each group of drivers (which will have a category
 *      in the driver tree view on the page) must be
 *      introduced by the "CATEGORY" keyword (case-sensitive),
 *      followed by a block in block brackets ("{...}").
 *
 *      In that block, each "driver" (which may actually
 *      consist of several CONFIG.SYS statements) must
 *      be introduced by a DRIVER statement:
 *
 *      DRIVER (    "command=", "param",
 *                  "title",
 *                  flags
 *             ),
 *      DRIVER ( ... )
 *
 *      In each DRIVER block, specify one or more parameters
 *      separated by commas. The order of parameters is not
 *      important.
 *
 *      1)  A DRIVER statement requires two parameters first,
 *          being the CONFIG.SYS keyname to search for (e.g.
 *          "BASEDEV=", "DEVICE=", "IFS=" etc), and the driver
 *          file name _without_ path specification.
 *          Both are _not_ case-sensitive.
 *
 *          At least one CONFIG statement must be present per
 *          DRIVER statement.
 *
 *      2)  The third parameter  is considered the driver
 *          description, which appears on the "Drivers" page
 *          when the driver gets selected in the tree view.
 *
 *          There must be exactly one driver title per DRIVER
 *          statement.
 *
 *      4)  _Optionally_, you can specify a driver flags parameter:
 *
 *          DRVF_CMDREF   item has entry in CMDREF.INF (enables
 *                        the context menu item)
 *
 *          DRVF_NOPARAMS driver accepts no parameters at all
 *                        (disables "Parameters" entry field)
 *
 *      Note: Support for the "Configure" button (with the
 *            driver's configuration dialog) is hard-coded
 *            into XWorkplace and cannot be changed using
 *            this file. The "Configure" button is enabled
 *            automatically based on the driver's filename
 *            if a corresponding dialog exists in XWorkplace.
 *            To create a "Configure" dialog, you must create
 *            and modify code in "src\config\drivdlgs.c".
