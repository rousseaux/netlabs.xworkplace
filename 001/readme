1. INTRODUCTION
===============

    Welcome to XWorkplace V0.9.3. This version fixes more bugs,
    including the infamous "folder no-close" bug, and adds new
    features.

    XWorkplace is a complex set of replacement classes for the
    OS/2 Workplace Shell. Consider this the WPS upgrade IBM
    should have released with OS/2 Warp 4.

    XWorkplace can add features to pretty much all parts of the
    system, such as generic object features, folder enhancements,
    replacement icons, CONFIG.SYS settings, and much, much more.

    All parts of XWorkplace are fully configurable and can be
    selectively enabled in case something is going wrong.

    XWorkplace is the successor to XFolder V0.85 and contains
    all of it, except the bugs.

    For an introduction to XWorkplace's many features, please
    open the "XWorkplace User Guide" (XFLDR001.INF).

    NOTE:

    This is still a developer's release. It is not guaranteed
    to be stable in every environment. Lots of new things have
    been added since the last public XFolder release (which was
    V0.85), and even though these are working on my system, this
    does not mean it will work on yours. So beware.

    This README has additional information which is not included
    in the XWorkplace User Guide. Please read through all of this
    before installing.

    After installation, you can find this README in the main
    install directory.


2. INSTALLATION
===============

    XWorkplace is installed using WarpIN.

    If you are still unsure whether you should use XWorkplace at
    this point, you can have WarpIN unpack the XWorkplace files
    on your hard disk only without registering and replacing
    Workplace Shell classes. This will not alter your system's
    behavior yet.

    To do this, disable the "Register WPS classes" flag on the
    respective page which WarpIN will show you after you press
    the "Next" button a few times.

    You can then read through XWorkplace's documentation first
    and decide then whether to actually register XWorkplace's
    classes. To do this later, simply open this WarpIN archive
    again.

    Note: Use WarpIN V0.9.1 or higher to install this archive.
    Since WarpIN V0.9.0 will be unable to create the XWorkplace
    objects on your Desktop, with that version, you'll have to
    execute BIN\CROB001.CMD manually after installation (in the
    XWorkplace target directory tree).


3. UPGRADING
============

    Upgrading from XWorkplace
    -------------------------

    If you have an older XWorkplace installed when installing
    this version, you MUST use WarpIN V0.9.2 also. If you are
    still using an older WarpIN version, you must completely
    de-install XWorkplace before installing this version.
    Alternatively, manually kill XWPDAEMN.EXE before installing.

    With the latest WarpIN, you will get a notification message
    that XWPDAEMN.EXE is running. Have WarpIN kill that program
    (which is the XWorkplace Daemon), and you can overwrite your
    existing installation.

    If upgrading doesn't work, have WarpIN remove the installed
    XWorkplace version first, restart the WPS, and install the
    new version then.


    Upgrading from XFolder
    ----------------------

    XWorkplace is the successor to XFolder (the last XFolder
    version was V0.85).

    XWorkplace and XFolder cannot coexist, since XWorkplace
    provides all the features of XFolder 0.85 plus many bugfixes
    and even more features.

    As a result, if XFolder is installed, XWorkplace will
    disable your XFolder installation.

    You should install XWorkplace to a directory OTHER than
    your existing XFolder directory to make sure no file
    conflicts occur. Several people have reported that
    installing to the same directory can hang your WPS.

    XWorkplace can take over your existing XFolder 0.85 settings,
    if present. You will be prompted for that during the first
    WPS restart after installation. However, many new settings
    have arrived, so many will be initially disabled.

    If you prefer to go back to your existing XFolder installation
    later (after all, this is a developer's release), have WarpIN
    de-install XWorkplace and install XFolder again, using
    INSTALL.CMD in your XFolder directory. Your old XFolder
    settings remain untouched by XWorkplace.


4. NATIONAL LANGUAGE SUPPORT
============================

    This archive contains XWorkplace National Language Support
    (NLS) for English only. Even though XWorkplace is prepared
    for supporting additional languages, there are no other
    NLS packages available yet. These will be added to a later
    release.


5. GETTING STARTED
==================

    In any case, open the new "XWorkplace Setup" object first and
    go to the "Features" page. This is the most central place to
    enable XWorkplace features. Refer to the "Help" button there.


6. KNOWN LIMITATIONS
====================

    This version has known bugs. I have it running on my system for
    everyday work, but some things are a bit annoying, so be warned.

    As opposed to what XFLDR001.INF might be saying, the following
    does not work:

    1)  Christian Langanke's Animated Mouse Pointers for OS/2 are
        not yet included. This is currently in the works and will
        be added to a later release.

    2)  If "Extended associations" is enabled in XWPSetup, the new
        "File types" page in "Workplace Shell" is working, but XFldDataFile
        doesn't support the enhanced file type icons yet.
        You'll see the proper icons and associations in the "Open"
        submenu, but clicking on them will not open the proper
        association.

    4)  Trash can auto-delete on startup and shutdown don't work yet.

    5)  Trash can icons are somewhat shaky.

    6)  VIO windows started via object hotkeys never come up right to
        the foreground.

    7)  PageMage is completely experimental at this point. There's no
        configuration pages yet, and it moves windows around more than
        it really should. Please don't complain.

    Please check the BUGS and FEATURES files in this package also
    before reporting bugs or suggesting features. Thank you.
