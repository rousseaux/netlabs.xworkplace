1. INTRODUCTION
===============

    Welcome to XWorkplace V0.9.6.

    XWorkplace is a complex set of replacement classes for the
    OS/2 Workplace Shell to enhance the WPS's behavior in many
    ways. It now also contains a PM hook (a la NPSWPS) to enhance
    mouse and keyboard operations. As opposed to other PM hooks,
    all configuration is done via true WPS settings notebooks.

    Consider this the WPS upgrade IBM should have released with
    OS/2 Warp 4. XWorkplace is the successor to XFolder V0.85 and
    contains all of it, except the bugs.

    XWorkplace can add features to pretty much all parts of the
    system, such as generic object features, folder enhancements,
    replacement icons, CONFIG.SYS settings, keyboard and mouse
    operation, and much, much more.

    All parts of XWorkplace are fully configurable and can be
    selectively enabled in case something is going wrong.

    This README has additional information which is not included
    in the XWorkplace User Guide. Please read through all of this
    before installing.

    After installation, you can find this README in the main
    install directory.


    About this release
    ------------------

    This version is mainly another bugfix release compared
    to previous versions. Most importantly, extended file
    associations should work now.

    For details, refer to the "XWorkplace User Guide" after
    unpacking the files. To extract the documentation only,
    see "2. INSTALLATION" below.


2. INSTALLATION
===============

    XWorkplace must be installed using WarpIN.

    Note: Use WarpIN V0.9.3 or higher to install this archive.
    Older versions will not be able to create the XWorkplace
    WPS objects and will probably fail when upgrading XWorkplace
    from a previous version.

    If you are still unsure whether you should use XWorkplace at
    this point, and if you have WarpIN V0.9.6 installed, you can
    use WIC.EXE (from the WarpIN package) to unpack the files only
    and read the documentation first.

    Type "wic -x xwp-0-9-6.wpi" to extract all of the WarpIN
    archive into the current directory.

    This way can then read through XWorkplace's documentation
    first and decide then whether to actually register
    XWorkplace's classes. To do this later, simply double-click
    on XWorkplace's WarpIN (.WPI) archive again.

    ---> NOTE: In any case, before installing, MAKE A WPS BACKUP.


3. UPGRADING
============

    Upgrading from XWorkplace
    -------------------------

    With the latest WarpIN, you will get a notification message
    that XWPDAEMN.EXE is running. Have WarpIN kill that program
    (which is the XWorkplace Daemon), and you can overwrite your
    existing installation.

    If upgrading doesn't work, have WarpIN remove the installed
    XWorkplace version first, restart the WPS, and install the
    new version then.


    Upgrading from XFolder
    ----------------------

    XWorkplace is the successor to XFolder (the last XFolder
    version was V0.85).

    XWorkplace and XFolder cannot coexist, since XWorkplace
    provides all the features of XFolder 0.85 plus many bugfixes
    and even more features.

    As a result, if XFolder is installed, XWorkplace will
    disable your XFolder installation.

    You should install XWorkplace to a directory OTHER than
    your existing XFolder directory to make sure no file
    conflicts occur. Several people have reported that
    installing to the same directory can hang your WPS.

    XWorkplace can take over your existing XFolder 0.85 settings,
    if present. You will be prompted for that during the first
    WPS restart after installation. However, many new settings
    have arrived, so many will be initially disabled.

    If you prefer to go back to your existing XFolder installation
    later (after all, this is a developer's release), have WarpIN
    de-install XWorkplace and install XFolder again, using
    INSTALL.CMD in your XFolder directory. Your old XFolder
    settings remain untouched by XWorkplace.


4. NATIONAL LANGUAGE SUPPORT
============================

    This archive contains XWorkplace National Language Support
    (NLS) for English only. Even though XWorkplace is prepared
    for supporting additional languages, there are no other
    NLS packages available yet. These will be added to a later
    release.


5. GETTING STARTED
==================

    In any case, after installation, open the new "XWorkplace Setup"
    object first and go to the "Features" page. This is the most
    central place to enable XWorkplace features. Press the "Help"
    button there to get more information.


6. KNOWN LIMITATIONS
====================

    The following issues are known to cause problems with this
    release.

    Please check the BUGS and FEATURES files in this package also
    before reporting bugs or suggesting features. Thank you.

    As opposed to what XFLDR001.INF might be saying, the following
    does not work:

    1)  Christian Langanke's Animated Mouse Pointers for OS/2 are
        not yet included. This is still in the works and will be
        added to a later release.

        If you have Christian's old package installed, you can keep
        it running, it causes no problems.

        The AMPTR sources are now on the Netlabs CVS server in the
        XWorkplace archives and compile with the rest of XWorkplace,
        but there's still some work left. If anybody finds the time
        to do the remaining integration work, any help is welcome.

    2)  Extended file associations are working now, but they will
        noticeably slow down folder populating.

    3)  Even though I've fixed many PageMage bugs with V0.9.4,
        there are still a number of problems left. PageMage doesn't
        shouldn't hang system any more, but it has problems tracking
        windows at times. PageMage 0.9.6 is essentially unchanged
        from 0.9.4.

    4)  There are problems with WPS restarts and FP13/14. This is
        an OS/2 kernel bug which IBM says has been fixed with kernel
        build level 14.050, so this will probably be fixed with FP15
        as well.

    5)  From time to time, creating folders from templates (using the
        context menu items) can solidly crash the system with a black
        screen. Some people never get this, but I do from time to time.
        This problem has been reported for all XFolder and XWorkplace
        versions, and it's apparently a WPS bug.

        If you have never had problems with "Create another", don't
        worry, nothing has changed.

        However, if, after using "Create another", the system freezes
        and the hard disk rattles like crazy, press Ctrl+Alt+Del
        IMMEDIATELY to avoid the black screen. This is a symptom of
        the swap file growing constantly until the swap disk is full,
        which will then cause a trap somewhere.

    6)  XWPString is still experimental. Drag'n'drop and confirmations
        don't work. XWPString will be replaced with a different
        implementation in the future, so don't count on it.
