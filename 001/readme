INTRODUCTION
============

    XWorkplace is a complex set of replacement classes for the
    OS/2 Workplace Shell. It can add features to pretty much all
    parts of the system, such as generic object features, folder
    enhancements, replacement icons, CONFIG.SYS settings, and
    much, much more.

    All parts of XWorkplace are fully configurable and can be
    selectively enabled.

    For an introduction to XWorkplace's many features, please
    open the "XWorkplace User Guide" (XFLDR001.INF).

    This is described thoroughly in XFolder's Online Reference.
