1. INTRODUCTION
===============

    Welcome to XWorkplace V0.9.4.

    XWorkplace is a complex set of replacement classes for the
    OS/2 Workplace Shell. Consider this the WPS upgrade IBM
    should have released with OS/2 Warp 4. XWorkplace is the
    successor to XFolder V0.85 and contains all of it, except
    the bugs.

    XWorkplace can add features to pretty much all parts of the
    system, such as generic object features, folder enhancements,
    replacement icons, CONFIG.SYS settings, keyboard and mouse
    operation, and much, much more.

    All parts of XWorkplace are fully configurable and can be
    selectively enabled in case something is going wrong.

    This README has additional information which is not included
    in the XWorkplace User Guide. Please read through all of this
    before installing.

    After installation, you can find this README in the main
    install directory.


    About this release
    ------------------

    This version is mainly another bugfix release compared
    to previous versions. This version should work much better
    than V0.9.3. Dozens of bugs have been fixed.

    For details, refer to the "XWorkplace User Guide" after
    unpacking the files. To extract the documentation only,
    see "2. INSTALLATION" below.

    Even though stability has increased, this is still a
    developer's  release. It is not guaranteed to be stable
    in every environment. It is running on my system for
    everyday's work, but that doesn't mean it will run on
    yours.


2. INSTALLATION
===============

    XWorkplace must be installed using WarpIN.

    Note: Use WarpIN V0.9.3 or higher to install this archive.
    Older versions will not be able to create the XWorkplace
    WPS objects and will probably fail when upgrading XWorkplace
    from a previous version.

    If you are still unsure whether you should use XWorkplace at
    this point, you can have WarpIN unpack the XWorkplace files
    on your hard disk only without registering and replacing
    Workplace Shell classes. This will not alter your system's
    behavior yet.

    To do this, disable the "Register WPS classes" flag on the
    respective page which WarpIN will show you after you press
    the "Next" button a few times.

    You can then read through XWorkplace's documentation first
    and decide then whether to actually register XWorkplace's
    classes. To do this later, simply double-click on
    XWorkplace's WarpIN (.WPI) archive again.


3. UPGRADING
============

    Upgrading from XWorkplace
    -------------------------

    With the latest WarpIN, you will get a notification message
    that XWPDAEMN.EXE is running. Have WarpIN kill that program
    (which is the XWorkplace Daemon), and you can overwrite your
    existing installation.

    If upgrading doesn't work, have WarpIN remove the installed
    XWorkplace version first, restart the WPS, and install the
    new version then.


    Upgrading from XFolder
    ----------------------

    XWorkplace is the successor to XFolder (the last XFolder
    version was V0.85).

    XWorkplace and XFolder cannot coexist, since XWorkplace
    provides all the features of XFolder 0.85 plus many bugfixes
    and even more features.

    As a result, if XFolder is installed, XWorkplace will
    disable your XFolder installation.

    You should install XWorkplace to a directory OTHER than
    your existing XFolder directory to make sure no file
    conflicts occur. Several people have reported that
    installing to the same directory can hang your WPS.

    XWorkplace can take over your existing XFolder 0.85 settings,
    if present. You will be prompted for that during the first
    WPS restart after installation. However, many new settings
    have arrived, so many will be initially disabled.

    If you prefer to go back to your existing XFolder installation
    later (after all, this is a developer's release), have WarpIN
    de-install XWorkplace and install XFolder again, using
    INSTALL.CMD in your XFolder directory. Your old XFolder
    settings remain untouched by XWorkplace.


4. NATIONAL LANGUAGE SUPPORT
============================

    This archive contains XWorkplace National Language Support
    (NLS) for English only. Even though XWorkplace is prepared
    for supporting additional languages, there are no other
    NLS packages available yet. These will be added to a later
    release.


5. GETTING STARTED
==================

    In any case, after installation, open the new "XWorkplace Setup"
    object first and go to the "Features" page. This is the most
    central place to enable XWorkplace features. Press the "Help"
    button there to get more information.


6. KNOWN LIMITATIONS
====================

    This version has known bugs, even though I have fixed dozens
    with this release.

    Please check the BUGS and FEATURES files in this package also
    before reporting bugs or suggesting features. Thank you.

    As opposed to what XFLDR001.INF might be saying, the following
    does not work:

    1)  Christian Langanke's Animated Mouse Pointers for OS/2 are
        not yet included. This is still in the works and will be
        added to a later release.

        If you have Christian's old package installed, you can keep
        it running, it causes no problems.

        The AMPTR sources are now on the Netlabs CVS server in the
        XWorkplace archives and compile with the rest of XWorkplace,
        but there's still some work left. If anybody finds the time
        to do the remaining integration work, any help is welcome.

    2)  If "Extended associations" is enabled in XWPSetup, the new
        "File types" page in "Workplace Shell" is working, but
        XFldDataFile doesn't support the enhanced file type icons yet.
        You'll see the proper icons and associations in the "Open"
        submenu, but clicking on them will not open the proper
        association.

    3)  Even though I've fixed many PageMage bugs with this release,
        there might still be a number of problems left. At least
        PageMage doesn't hang the system all the time any more.
        Besides, sticky windows work now.

    4)  I had some problems with WPS restarts and XWorkplace 0.9.3
        under Warp 4, FP 13. I have now installed FP14, and it seems
        to be working mostly OK with V0.9.4. See the "BUGS" file for
        more.

    5)  From time to time, creating folders from templates (using the
        context menu items) can solidly crash the system with a black
        screen. Some people never get this, but I do from time to time.
        I think I have found the problem, but solving it requires some
        more debugging and a major redesign of my folder object
        initialization. This problem has been reported for all XFolder
        and XWorkplace versions.

        If you have never had problems with "Create another", don't
        worry, nothing has changed.

        However, if, after using "Create another", the system freezes
        and the hard disk rattles like crazy, press Ctrl+Alt+Del
        IMMEDIATELY to avoid the black screen. This is a symptom of
        the swap file growing constantly until the swap disk is full,
        which will then cause a trap somewhere.
