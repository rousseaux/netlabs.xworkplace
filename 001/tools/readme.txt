"001\TOOLS" readme
(W) Ulrich M”ller Dec 1, 1999

The "TOOLS" directory contains additional tools which are needed to
compose XWorkplace NLS. Right now, this only has a language-specific
version of Andrew Pavel Zabolotny's HTML2IPF tool. See PROGREF.INF
for details.

This version automatically gets used by the makefiles in the subdirs
of "001" to translate HTML to IPF.
