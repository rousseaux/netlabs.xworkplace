# Makefile for XWorkplace National Language Support.
#
# A makefile contains information about how several source files
# relate to each other, especially which code modules must be updated
# when certain source files change.
#
# For use with IBM NMAKE, which is part of IBM C-Set/2 and VisualAge C++.
# This file will probably not work with other MAKE utilities, such as
# GNU make or DMAKE.
