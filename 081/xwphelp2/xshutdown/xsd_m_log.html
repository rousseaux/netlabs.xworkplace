<BODY>
This setting determines whether &xshutdown; will create a log file named XSHUTDWN.LOG
in the root directory of your boot drive and write lots of information into it while
the eXtended Shutdown or Desktop restart is in progress.
<P>This log file might help you to track down errors that
might occur during &xshutdown;.
<P>Note that enabling this setting might slow down &xshutdown; significantly. You don't
need the log file if &xshutdown; is working fine on your system.
<P>This setting only has an effect if the Extended Shutdown or Restart Desktop features
are enabled, and it affects both functions at once.
