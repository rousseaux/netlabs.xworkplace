Metafiles contain a series of attributes that set
color, shape, and size, usually of a picture or a
drawing. After this series is drawn, you can view
the assembled image.

<P>Presentation Manager (PM) printer drivers hold print jobs in
metafile format while they wait to print. Metafiles can be
created by applications using the &os2; graphics engine that is part of PM.

<P>By default, metafiles are associated with the
&os2; <A HREF="objects/obj_os2picview.html">Picture Viewer</A>,
which can display and print metafiles.
