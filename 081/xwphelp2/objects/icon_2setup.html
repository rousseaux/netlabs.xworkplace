        &xwp;: Object Setup String
    </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<!-- this is all new with V0.9.4 -->
<BODY>
The "Setup" entry field
<!-- V0.9.16: on the "Object" page -->
allows to view the current object's
setup string.
This string is composed by &xwp; directly from the object's settings.
<!-- V0.9.16: changed this -->
The entry field is read-only and cannot be changed, but you can copy its
contents to the
<!-- V0.9.20: link added -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_clipboard.html">clipboard</A>
by using the <CODE>Ctrl+Insert</CODE> keys.

<!-- V0.9.13: added this -->
<!-- V0.9.16: slightly changed -->
<P>See <A HREF="glossary/gls_objstrings.html">"Setup strings"</A> for more
information about WPS setup strings and a list of the most frequently
used ones.

<!-- V0.9.13: removed chunk here -->

You can use this setup string to create a similar object using
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_cmd_rexx.html">REXX</A>
functions.
<!-- V0..9.16 See the appendices of the <I>&xwp; User Guide</I> for more about those functions
and a listing of many setup strings. -->

<P>Presently, &xwp; can decode setup strings of the following classes:

<!-- V0.9.16: added links -->
<UL><LI><A HREF="objects/string_1wpobject.html">WPObject</A>
<P><LI><A HREF="objects/string_2wpfolder.html">WPFolder</A>
<!-- V0.9.20: removed XFolder link -->
<P><LI><A HREF="objects/string_5wpprogram.html">WPProgram</A>;
<!-- V0.9.20: removed "and XWPProgramFile;" -->
for these classes, the setup string can become
particularly long. You will also see that the WPS stores the DOS setup variables
("DOS" or "&winos2; properties" button on the "Session" page) in the program's
<!-- V0.9.20: link added -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_env.html">environment</A>, using <CODE>SET xxx=yyy</CODE> strings.
<P><LI><A HREF="objects/string_7xcenter.html">XCenter</A>

</UL>If setup strings are defined of a more specific class, but &xwp; cannot
decode them, you will only get the setup strings of the parent class(es).
Most notably, setup strings of WPPalette (and subclasses), WPDesktop/XFldDesktop,
WPDisk/XFldDisk,
WPHost, WPLaunchPad, WPNetgrp, WPPdr, WPPrinter, WPRPrinter, WPServer, WPShadow,
and WPUrl are not supported.

<P>However, even for the classes listed above,
not all setup strings are supported by &xwp;
<!-- V0.9.13: rewrote all the following -->
since there is no standard interface how to retrieve them. Again, see
<A HREF="glossary/gls_objstrings.html">"Setup strings"</A> for details.
