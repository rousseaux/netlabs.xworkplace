"Enhanced Editor" is a powerful editor program that allows
you to work on multiple files at the same time. While the
<A HREF="objects/obj_os2eexe.html">&os2; &eexe;</A> is mainly
used for quickly viewing or editing
small files, the enhanced editor can manage more complex projects.
It can do syntax highlighting and many
other advanced features, so many programmers use it as their
favorite programming editor.

<P>For detailed help, start the enhanced editor and select the
"Quick Reference" item located under the "Help" menu bar choice.

<P>You can also start the Enhanced Editor by typing
<CODE>EPM</CODE> at a <A HREF="glossary/gls_cmd.html">command prompt</A>
and pressing Enter.
