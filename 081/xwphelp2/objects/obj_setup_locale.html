<P>The <B>"Locale" object</B> allows you to change country-specific settings
for your system.

<P>This folder resides in the &link_syssetupfdr;.
Open the Desktop's <A HREF="glossary/gls_popmenu.html">&popmenu;</A> and select
"&syssetup;" to have that folder opened quickly.

<P>A <B>locale</B> is a set of values that define how number, date, time,
monetary, and other country-specific values are displayed. Well-programmed
applications should be aware of these specifics and respect the selections
you make here.

<P>If you mark a locale object as the "default" locale, all compliant applications
on your system will use these settings. For example, the &xcenter;
<A HREF="xcenter/xc_clock.html">date and time widgets</A> will.
