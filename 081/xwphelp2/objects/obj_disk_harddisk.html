<P>A <B>hard disk volume object</B> represents a
<A HREF="glossary/gls_volume.html">volume</A> on a hard disk device.
You can have one or several hard disks in your computer, and each
hard disk can have one or several volumes.

<P><A HREF="glossary/gls_dblclk.html">Double-click</A> on the object
to open a new window that displays the &link_folders; on the volume.

<P>A hard disk is a reusable storage device that holds information, such
as software and data, in files.
As opposed to diskettes, hard disks are fixed and non-removable. They
are hard-wired into your computer's case and usually not visible from outside.

<P>A hard disk is a whole lot faster than a diskette drive and can also store
much more information. Its capacity is therefore usually measured in
<A HREF="glossary/gls_bytes.html">gigabytes</A>.

<P>Hard disks are typically used to store both software and files locally.
Since your computer loses all information that is stored in its main memory
when it is turned off, it needs some way of permanently storing data. For
this, considering the complexity of today's software, hard disks are usually
the most effective means.

<P>For example, the &os2; operating system itself is stored on a hard disk.
If you install additional software, it is usually copied to your hard disk
as well. Install programs then usually create
&link_progobjs; pointing to the
<A HREF="objects/obj_pgmf.html">program files</A> that were copied.
