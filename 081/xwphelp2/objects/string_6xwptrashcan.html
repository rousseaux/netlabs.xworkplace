<BODY>
<CODE>XWPTrashCan</CODE> is the WPS class for the &xwp; trash can object
(see <A HREF="glossary/gls_wpsclasses.html">WPS classes</A> for details).
Since the
trash can is just a special folder, in addition to the <CODE>XWPTrashCan</CODE>
strings listed below, the trash can also supports the strings of the
<CODE><A HREF="objects/string_1wpobject.html">WPObject</A></CODE>
and <CODE><A HREF="objects/string_2wpfolder.html">WPFolder</A></CODE>
<!-- V0.9.20: removed XFolder link -->
classes.

<P>To get the trash can object, invoke these strings on the object
with the ID <CODE>&lt;XWP_TRASHCAN&gt;</CODE>.

<DL>

<DD>Empties the trash can. No confirmation is displayed.
<BR>This is not really a "setting", but rather a command to be performed on the
trash can
Note that the call does not return until the trash can has been emptied.
