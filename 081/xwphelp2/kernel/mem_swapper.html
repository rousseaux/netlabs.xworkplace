The settings in the "Swap file" group allow you to influence the way
&os2; manages its swap file.
All these settings correspond to the <CODE>SWAPPATH</CODE> command
in &cfgsys;. See the <A HREF="cmdref.inf#swappath">SWAPPATH documentation</A> in the
<I>&os2; Command Reference</I> for details.

<P>For more information about this topic, see <A HREF="glossary/gls_mem_paging.html">Paging</A>.

<UL><LI>The <B>"Current size"</B> field shows you the current size of the &os2; swap file
(<CODE>SWAPPER.DAT</CODE>).
This display is continually updated when the swapp file's size changes.

<P><LI>The <B>"Main memory size"</B> field shows you how much physical main memory
(RAM) you have installed on your system.
This number plus the size of the swap file (above) makes up the amount of virtual
memory which is actually used by &os2; at the moment.

<P><LI>The <B>"Minimum size"</B> field lets you determine which size the swap file
will never fall short of. You should set a reasonably high value here because otherwise
&os2; will keep adjusting the swap file size, which costs a lot of time.

<P>The default value of 2 MB is definitely too low for most systems, unless you have a lot
of memory installed. For example, if the current size of the swap file is 20 MB and
you have a minimum size of 2 MB set, you should raise that value to 32 MB to avoid
unnecessary swap file size adjustments.

<P>This setting corresponds to the third parameter of the <CITE>SWAPPATH</CITE>
&cfgsys; command.

<P><LI>The <B>"Warn threshold"</B> field lets you determine when &os2; will warn you
that you're running out of disk space on the drive which holds the swap file when
it tries to increase its size. For example, if you have set 20 MB here and &os2; finds
out that only 19 MB disk space is left on the swap file drive, you'll get a warning
message.

<P>This setting corresponds to the second parameter of the <CITE>SWAPPATH</CITE>
&cfgsys; command.

<P><LI>The <B>"Path"</B> entry field allows you to specifiy the location of the swap
file. You may enter any valid directory here. Note however that you cannot change
the name of the swap file, which will always be <CITE>SWAPPER.DAT</CITE>.

<P>In general, you should put the swap file on an HPFS drive, because this avoids
fragmentation and is generally faster. In addition, you should put the swap file on
the most used partition of the least used hard disk (if you have several hard disks
built into your computer). This avoids unneccessary movement of the read/write
heads of the hard disks when the swap file is accessed. Of course however, if that
partition resides on a hard drive which is much slower than the others, a different
hard drive might be preferrable.

<P>This setting corresponds to the first parameter of the <CITE>SWAPPATH</CITE>
&cfgsys; command.

<P>Please note that when you change the swap file location, the old swap file will
not automatically be deleted during the next reboot. You should therefore remember
the old location and manually delete the old swap file after the system has been
rebooted, or otherwise several MB of hard drive space will remain occupied.
