<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.3 -->
<BODY>
This page allows you to view the maintenance levels of the most important
components of your &os2; system.

<P>In order to keep track of version levels of any software, IBM has created
a special type of file, the "syslevel" file. Such a file is always called
<CODE>SYSLEVEL.XXX</CODE>, with <CODE>XXX</CODE> being any extension. For
each software component, one such syslevel file exists in some directory.

<P>The "Syslevels" page goes thru the &os2; system directories, including
those of the networking components, and parses all the syslevel
files which are found.

<P>The most important field is the <B>"Syslevel"</B> field, which normally has a
combination of letters and digits. There is no real rule for how to interpret
this field, and IBM uses it differently for each component. The trailing numbers
usually tell you the fixpak level, however.

<P>If several fixpaks have been installed over time, the <B>"Previous"</B>
field will show you the previous syslevel over which the last fixpak was
installed.
