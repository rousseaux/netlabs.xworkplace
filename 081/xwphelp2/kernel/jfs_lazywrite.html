<BODY>
If the <B>"Lazy write"</B> box is checked, JFS will defer writing data back to
disk to a background thread.
See <A HREF="glossary/gls_caches.html">"File-system caches"</A> for an explanation.

<P>If lazy-write is enabled, you can fine-tune the JFS cache's behavior with the
three settings below (all values are in seconds):

<OL><LI>The <B>"Synch time"</B> setting determines the interval at which the
JFS-internal synchronization thread runs. This defaults to 64.

<P><LI>The <B>"Max age"</B> setting determines the maximum amount of time that
data may be held in the cache. This defaults to 256.

<P><LI>The <B>"Buffer idle"</B> value determines the amount of time during which
JFS will consider a change to be "recent". Changes newer than this value are
not written unless the last write was older than "max age." This defaults to 8.

</OL>
