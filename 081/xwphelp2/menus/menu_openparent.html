Select "Open parent" to display the parent
<A HREF="objects/obj_fdr_main.html">folder</A> of the current
folder.

<P>The parent folder is the folder which contains the current folder.
It will be opened in its default view, as if you had double-clicked
on it. See <A HREF="objects/obj_fdr_views.html">folder views</A> for
more information.

<P>Note that &xwp; also predefines the <B>Backspace</B> folder hotkey
for opening the parent folder.
