The "Delete" menu item deletes the currently selected objects.
By default, they will be moved into the
<A HREF="objects/obj_trash.html">&xwp; trash can</A>
so you can recover objects that were deleted accidentally.

<P>See <A HREF="tasks/tsk_delete.html">"Deleting objects"</A> for additional
remarks and warnings.
