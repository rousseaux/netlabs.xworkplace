With &xwp;'s folder content menus, you may take a look at the contents of a
<!-- V0.9.19: link added -->
<A HREF="objects/obj_fdr_main.html">folder</A>
without actually having to open a folder view. This may save some room on your
display.

<!-- V0.9.19: rewrote all the following -->
<IFNDEF __NOFOLDERCONTENTS__>
<P>Folder content menus are added according to the following:

<UL><LI>If you have enabled "Add folder content menu" on the "Menu" pages in
the &link_wpsobj;, every folder
will receive a folder content menu which displays its own content.

<P><LI>In addition, you can declare any folder to be a <B>"favorite folder"</B>
on the "View" page in each folder's
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>.
All such favorite folders will be added to all folder menus on the system as
well. For example, if you would like the Desktop's contents to show in all
menus, declare the Desktop to be a "favorite folder".

<P><LI>Finally, folder content menus are also displayed from the
<A HREF="xcenter/xc_main.html">&xcenter;</A> for
<A HREF="xcenter/xc_objbtn.html">object button widgets</A> that represent
folders. To remove an object button from an &xcenter;,
click on it with mouse button 2 and select "Remove widget".

</UL>
&xwp; can also <B>display icons</B> of the objects that were collected in
the folder content menus. Whether this happens is determined by the
respective setting of the "Menu" pages in the "Workplace Shell" objects,
which affects all content menus on the system.
</IFNDEF>

<P>Folder content menus behave similar to those of the &warpcenter;.
<!-- V0.9.19: removed this... that was introduced with &warp4;. -->
Any object that is contained in the folder whose contents are displayed is turned
into a menu item. Subfolders of the folder are turned into submenus. As a result,
you can browse through all of the folders contents, including all subfolders, by
opening the respective submenus.

<P>The following special <B>mouse actions</B> are available in folder content
menus:

<UL><LI>If you click on any icon that is not a submenu (that is, not a subfolder),
the corresponding object will be opened in its default view (as if you had
double-clicked on it in a regular folder view).
<P><LI>If you open a submenu, the submenu will fill itself with the corresponding
subfolder's contents, possibly including more subfolders.
<P><LI>If you click on a folder menu with mouse button 2, the folder will be
opened in its default view as a window (as if you had
double-clicked on it in a regular folder view).
