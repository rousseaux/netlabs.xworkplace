<!-- this page is all new with V0.9.0 -->
<BODY>
<!-- V0.9.20: rewrote this -->
The "Module" pages appear in the properties notebooks of all executable
files to display additional information about an executable module.

<!-- V0.9.20: added this -->
<P>A <B>"module"</B> is the &os2; kernel's representation about an executable
file that was successfully loaded. This can either be a
<A HREF="objects/obj_pgmf.html">program file</A> or a
<A HREF="glossary/gls_dll.html">DLL</A>.

<P>The information on this page is retrieved directly from the executable
file and cannot be changed.
All executables on operating systems which maintain some compatibility with DOS
(such as &os2; and Windows) still use the same EXE header as DOS 3.x. However,
for the "extended" EXE formats used by &os2; and Windows, after the old DOS header,
additional executable headers appear in the file. &xwp; attempts to analyze
the various headers in the file and shows the results on this page.

<P>In the <B>"Module format"</B> group, the <B>"Executable format"</B>
will be one of the following:

<UL><LI><B>"DOS 3.x":</B> The file only has the old DOS EXE header, so it is
probably a DOS file.

<P><LI><B>"Linear Executable (LX)":</B>
<!-- V0.9.16: rewrote this section, moved this up -->
This is the native OS/2 executable format that is used by 32-bit modules,
including 32-bit libraries. Most EXE and
<!-- V0.9.20: added link -->
<A HREF="glossary/gls_dll.html">DLL</A>
<!-- V0.9.20: modified the following -->
files that were designed to run on OS/2 version 2.x or higher (including
eComStation) will have this format.
<!-- end V0.9.16 -->

<P><LI><B>"New Executable (NE)"</B>:
<!-- V0.9.16: rewrote this section -->
This format was introduced
by IBM and Microsoft with OS/2 1.x and is still used for 16-bit executables
under both Windows and OS/2. Most Windows 3.x applications will have this
format, as well as 16-bit OS/2 applications (including 16-bit libraries).
<!-- V0.9.20: modified this -->
Most &os2; device drivers will have this format as well.
<!-- end V0.9.16 -->

<P><LI><B>"Portable Executable (PE)":</B> This format was introduced
<!-- V0.9.16: rewrote this  -->
by Microsoft for 32-bit Windows applications and is extensively used under
all Windows versions since Windows 95 (including derivatives of Windows NT).
<!-- end V0.9.16 -->
Also, some Win32s applications (i.e. 32-bit applications
running under Windows 3.x) will have this format.
<!-- V0.9.9: added the following -->
OS/2 neither uses nor understands this format by default, but if you have Odin
installed, OS/2 can load such executables.
<!-- end V0.9.9 -->

</UL>The <B>"Target OS"</B> shows you the operating system for which this
executable was written. This will show one of "DOS 3.x", "DOS 4.x", "OS/2",
"Win16", "Win386", or "Win32". For some executable formats, &xwp; will
display the target OS as specified in the executable itself, for others it
will do a best guess.

<P>The <B>"Module description"</B> group shows you additional information about
the executable as specified by the executable's vendor.
<!-- V0.9.5: updated the following phrase -->
This can be retrieved for LX and NE formats.
This information will be the same as returned by the <CODE>BLDLEVEL.EXE</CODE>
command-line utility, which is shipped with &os2;.

<!-- V0.9.20: rewrote this -->
<P>Many &os2; executables use the special IBM "bldlevel" format to specify the vendor,
version, and description all in one string. If this format is obeyed, &xwp; will
display this information, otherwise only the "Description" field will be set.
