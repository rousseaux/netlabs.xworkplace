<BODY>
This page allows you to enable or disable the major &xwp; features globally.
Changing the settings on this page will affect &popmenu;s, object icons,
drag'n'drop behavior, object notebook page, etc.

<P>For a better overview, the features are organized into groups. Expand the
group items to view the feature settings.

<P>Each feature can be enabled or disabled by clicking on the <B>checkbox</B> next to
it, by double-clicking on the text, or by pressing the "Space" or "Enter" key
while the item is selected.

<P>All changed will take effect immediately, that is, after you've changed a
setting, you'll see that &xwp;'s behavior will change. To view the new
notebook pages which are related to a setting, you will need to re-open the
respective settings object however.

<P>If you move the mouse over a setting and keep it there for about a second,
you'll get more detailed <B>fly-over help</B> about that specific setting.

<P>Press <B>"Undo"</B> to restore the settings
that were in use before you opened this notebook page.
<P>Press <B>"Default"</B> to restore the settings
to the installation state. This will disable all features.

<P>Press the <B>"Setup &xwp; classes..."</B> button to be able to quickly
install/uninstall only some of the &xwp;
<!-- V0.9.13: added link -->
