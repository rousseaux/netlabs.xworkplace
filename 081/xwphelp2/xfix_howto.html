If you haven't made a <B>backup</B> of <CODE>OS2.INI</CODE> and
<CODE>OS2SYS.INI</CODE>, exit xfix and do it now, then restart.

<OL>
<BR><LI><B>Getting Started</B>

<UL>
<BR><LI>Select <B>Actions-&gt;Find invalid files</B> on the menubar.
This will identify handles for files and folders that have been deleted.
It may take a few moments to complete. When done, invalid handles will be
marked <IMG SRC="img/xfix_error.gif">.

<BR><LI>Select <B>Actions-&gt;Auto-Protect</B>. This will protect you from
deleting handles the WPS needs to operate correctly. These handles will be
marked <IMG SRC="img/xfix_protect.gif"> or <IMG SRC="img/xfix_safe.gif">.

<BR><LI>Select <B>Sort-&gt;Icon</B>. This will move all of the invalid
handles to the top of the list.
</UL>

<LI><B>Delete Invalid Handles</B>

<P>xfix can identify many problems but can only fix a few of them.
If your system is seriously corrupted, many of these problems may
still be present after using xfix,

<UL>
<BR><LI>Look in the "References" column for each invalid handle. If you
see a number and the words <CODE>Abstract objects</CODE>, you have non-file
objects such as shadows that have gotten lost.  To recover them, click
MB2 on that handle then select <B>Move abstracts to Desktop</B>. If you
don't do this, these objects will be deleted when you delete this handle.

<BR><LI>Highlight all of the invalid handles, then <B>Delete</B> them. You
can use the <CODE>Delete</CODE> key or select <CODE>Delete</CODE> from
the &popmenu;.
</UL>

<LI><B>Delete Unneeded Handles</B>

<P>This is where xfix is at its best.  You may have a huge number of
handles that the WPS will never use and do nothing except slow it down.
They point to valid files but are unnecessary in most cases and can
be deleted.

<UL>
<BR><LI>Select <B>Sort-&gt;Long Name</B> to sort the list by drive,
directory, and filename.

<BR><LI>Locate files and folders that have shadows on your Desktop, then
<B>Protect</B> them.  Either select <CODE>Protect</CODE> from the
&popmenu; or press <CODE>Ctrl+P</CODE>.

<BR><LI>Select <B>Sort-&gt;Extension</B>. Now, look at the "Short name"
column and scroll down until you see files sorted by their extension.

<BR><LI>Any handle that isn't already <IMG SRC="img/xfix_protect.gif">
protected may be one that you want to delete.  Again, <B>do not</B>
delete a handle if you have made a shadow for that file or folder.

<P>Good candidates for deletion are <CODE><B>.DLL</B></CODE> and
<CODE><B>.ZIP</B></CODE>.  Programmers can probably delete their
<CODE><B>.C</B></CODE>, <CODE><B>.CPP</B></CODE>, and
<CODE><B>.H</B></CODE> files.  If you have a large number of, say,
<CODE><B>.JPG</B></CODE> files and aren't sure whether to delete them,
just delete one or two of them.  After you close xfix, see if this
had any negative consequences -- if not, restart xfix and delete all
of them.

<BR><LI>If you have a policy of never creating WPS objects for files
in certain folders (for example, "DOWNLOADS" or "TEMP"),
then the handles for files in these folders can be deleted. Select
<B>Sort-&gt;Long Name</B> again to sort the list by path, locate
the folder, then delete the handles below it.
</UL>

<LI><B>Save and Exit</B>

<UL>
<BR><LI>The <B>status bar</B> at the bottom of the window should show
"0 invalid" and "0 orphans".  If not, select <B>Sort-&gt;Icon</B>.
The invalid <IMG SRC="img/xfix_error.gif"> handles will be at the
top of the list -- delete <IMG SRC="img/xfix_delete.gif"> them.
The orphans <IMG SRC="img/xfix_orphan.gif"> will be next -- protect
<IMG SRC="img/xfix_protect.gif"> them.

<BR><LI>Select <B>xfix-&gt;Write back to OS2SYS.INI</B>

<BR><LI>You will be prompted whether you want to remove the handles you
marked for deletion.  If there is a warning about orphans, press
<CODE>Cancel</CODE> and fix the problem.  If not, press <CODE>Yes</CODE>.

<BR><LI>Next, you will be asked if you really want to save your work.
Read the warnings, and if you are confident you haven't created any
new problems, answer <CODE>Yes</CODE>.

<BR><LI>Close the main window to exit xfix.
