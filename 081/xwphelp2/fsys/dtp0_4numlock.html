<BODY>
If <B>"Enable NumLock at startup"</B> is checked, &xwp; will
automatically turn on the "NumLock" key on the numeric keyboard while the
Desktop is starting up. Changing this setting will also enable/disable NumLock
immediately.
<!-- V0.9.19: , just for fun. -->
The "NumLock" key can still be disabled manually,
of course.

<!-- V0.9.20: rewrote this -->
<P>Note that this setting will only affect all programs running as
windows in the Presentation Manager session (including windowed command
prompts).
It will not affect DOS windows, full-screen or &winos2; sessions.
See <A HREF="glossary/gls_sessions.html">"session types"</A> for
details.
