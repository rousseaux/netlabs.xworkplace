Compared to other objects, the &xwp; trash can has a special "Icon" page.
Note that you cannot use this page to change the <B>icons</B> which are used
by the trash can. As opposed to other folders,
the trash can uses two different icons depending on whether
objects are currently in the trash can.

<IFNDEF __NOXWPSETUP__>
<P>If you have icon replacements enabled in the
<A HREF="objects/obj_xwpsetup.html">"&xwp; Setup" object</A>,
you can change the trash can icons as described in the
<I>&xwp; User Guide.</I>
