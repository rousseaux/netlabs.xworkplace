<BODY>
REXX is an interpreted programming language that is built into &os2;.
It uses common English words and is thus easy to learn for beginner
programmers. However, at the same time, it is still flexible and
powerful enough that more experienced programmers can use it too to
write more advanced applications.

<P>REXX uses a few powerful, general-purpose programming functions
and common arithmetical abilities, as well as OS/2 commands, within
a simple framework. Existing batch files can be converted to REXX
procedures, with more power and function. REXX is extensible with
external DLLs programmed in a compiler language, whose functions
are callable from REXX code.

<P>REXX files only operate in OS/2 sessions, must have a file name
extension of <CODE>.CMD</CODE>, and must start with a comment line
(<CODE>/*....*/</CODE>), which distinguishes them from regular
<A HREF="objects/obj_pgmf_batch.html">command files</A>.

<P>REXX is not only available for &os2;, but as an add-on for other
operating systems as well.
