<BODY>
A <B>dynamic link library (DLL)</B> is a special kind of executable file
containing code that can be shared between several applications.
Dynamic link libraries usually have a <CODE>.DLL</CODE> file name
extension.

<P>DLLs can either come with the operating system or with an application.
The system code of &os2; itself is largely contained in DLL files, too,
and can be found in the <CODE>OS2\DLL</CODE> directory on your boot drive.

<P>"Dynamic linking" means that the code in the module is only loaded
when some application demands it. If the code was already loaded by
another application, it is reused. This has several advantages:

<UL><LI>Several applications can actually <B>share the code</B> in a DLL,
which saves both disk space and your computer's main memory.

<P><LI>Applications can be <B>modularized.</B> For example, the National
Language Support (NLS) for a DLL can be separated into a DLL.
This allows for changing an application's language by exchanging
a single file. DLLs can also simplifies software support since
re-shipping an entire application is frequently not necessary to
fix defects.

<P><LI>DLLs can contain actual <B>subsystems</B> that are used by several
applications, since a DLL can share data between processes.
This allows for easier data exchange, for example, and is also one
of the the reasons why large portions of &os2; itself are contained in DLLs.

<P><LI>DLLs can be used to make an application <B>extensible.</B> If the
application has been designed to support extension DLLs,
anyone can develop such extensions which then seamlessly integrate
into the application. The finest example for this is the &os2; Workplace Shell
itself, which can be extended in functionality by adding third-party
add-ons. See <A HREF="glossary/gls_wpsclasses.html">"WPS classes"</A> for details.
Another example is the <A HREF="xcenter/xc_main.html">&xcenter;</A>, which
supports plug-in DLLs as extensions.
