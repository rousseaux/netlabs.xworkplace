<BODY>
<B>Hotkeys</B> are key combinations that, when pressed on the keyboard,
will cause the system to take a special action.

<P>There are several types of hotkeys.

<UL><LI>Many hotkeys are hard-wired into the system. These are
called <B>system keys</B> and work everywhere, independent of
the current application. For example, pressing <CODE>Ctrl+Alt+Del</CODE>
will always restart the computer.

<P>See <A HREF="wphelp.hlp#193">"Key assignments"</A> for a complete
list of system key assignments.

<P><LI><B>Object hotkeys</B> can be defined on the "Icon" page in every
object's
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>. After
assigning such a hotkey to an object,
you can open that object just by pressing that key, as if you had
double-clicked on it. For example, you can assign a hotkey to your
favorite calculator application to be able to open it more quickly.

<P>Object hotkeys work in the Presentation Manager
<A HREF="glossary/gls_sessions.html">session</A> only.

<P><LI>By contrast, <B>folder hotkeys</B> work only when a
<A HREF="objects/obj_fdr_views.html">folder view</A> is currently
active. For example, you can press <CODE>Ctrl+E</CODE> to have the
objects in the folder sorted by file name extensions.

<P>The &link_wpsobj; allows you to assign hotkeys to more than 30
folder actions on the "Folder hotkeys" page.
