The <B>"Enable"</B> checkbox determines whether &xwp; allows you to use
virtual desktops at all.

<P>If the box is checked, the rest of the page (and the following pages)
are activated, and the &pgr; window appears on your screen. You can
then switch between multiple desktops, as described in the
<A HREF="hook/pager_intro.html">&pgr; introduction</A>.

<P>If the box is unchecked, &pgr; is deactivated, and all windows that
might currently reside on other desktops are brought back to your screen.
You then only have one desktop again.

<!-- V0.9.20: added this -->

<P><B>Note:</B> The checkbox can only be checked at all if the &xwp; hook
is enabled. If the checkbox is grayed out, go to the "Features" page of
the <A HREF="objects/obj_xwpsetup.html">"&xwp; Setup" object</A> and
enable the &xwp; hook.
