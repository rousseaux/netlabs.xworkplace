This dialog allows you to view all the WPS classes which &xwp; consists
of and whether they are currently registered with the WPS class list.

<!-- V0.9.13: changed these 2 lines -->
<P>See <A HREF="glossary/gls_wpsclasses.html" TARGET="_top">"WPS classes"</A> for an
introduction to WPS classes.

<P>To register or deregister one of the classes, check or uncheck the respective
checkbox and press OK. This will require a Desktop restart.

a couple of seconds.
