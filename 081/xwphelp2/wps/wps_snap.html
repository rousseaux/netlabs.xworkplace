<BODY>
On this page you can configure &xwp;'s "Snap to grid" function.
Please see the <I>&xwp; User Guide</I> for details.

<P>The <B>"Enable"</B> box will add the "Snap to grid" menu item to every folder's
&popmenu;. This only applies to OPEN folders.
This setting may also be overridden on the "View" page in every folder's
<A HREF="glossary/gls_notebook.html">properties notebook</A>.

<P>Note that even though you might have disabled the "Snap to grid" menu item, you can still
configure a hotkey for it on the "Hotkeys" page in the
<!-- V0.9.4: link added -->
<A HREF="objects/obj_wps.html">"Workplace Shell" object.</A>

<P>The other four numeric settings
determine the grid upon which the objects will jump when you press "Snap to grid".

<P>All numbers represent pixels on the screen.

<P>The <B>"Origin"</B> numbers specify the first grid line to be used.
The X coordinate is counted from the left of the folder plane, the Y coordinate from
the bottom.
Note that if the folder has scroll bars, &xwp; will still count from the lower left
corner of the folder plane, even if it is presently invisible.

<P>The <B>"Spacing"</B> coordinates specify the distance between the following
grid lines, in X and Y direction (to the right and top), respectively.

<P><B>Example:</B> With X grid origin = "10" and X grid spacing = "50", the
vertical grid lines will be at 10, 60, 110, 160, etc. pixels.

<P>Press <B>"Undo"</B> to restore the settings
that were in use before you opened this notebook page.

<P>Press <B>"Default"</B> to restore the settings
to the installation state.
