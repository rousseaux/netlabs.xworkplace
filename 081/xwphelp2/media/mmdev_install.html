<BODY>
The "Install name" column shows you the installation name of each device.

<P>This name is internal to MMPM/2 and normally not used by installations.
This is what MMPM/2 uses internally to manage devices and corresponds to
the sections in the ASCII <CODE>MMPM2.INI</CODE> file in your MMOS2 directory.
