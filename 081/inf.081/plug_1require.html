<BODY>
To write a plug-in DLL, you need to be familiar with the following:

<OL><LI>The C programming language. There is no language support for the &os2;
Pascal dialects at this point.

<P><LI>Presentation Manager programming. A widget class is essentially a
PM window class (see <A HREF="plug_2terminology.html">"Terminology"</A>).

<P>If you haven't written a PM window class from scratch before, don't worry.
The samples will guide you, and it isn't that difficult. If you know what
a window procedure is, and if you know the difference between an owner and
a parent window and <CODE>WinSendMsg</CODE> and <CODE>WinPostMsg</CODE>,
you should be fine. Of course, the more you know, the better.

<P><LI>You should know what a DLL is, when and why they are used, and why
a DLL is not a process. ;-)

</OL>Now for the good news: You do <I>not</I> need to know WPS and/or
SOM programming, which should be a great relief to many contributors.

<P>Also, you can use any C compiler you want. Even EMX/GCC should do.
The only &xwp; code that is required are the headers that you are including,
which now come with the &xwp; binary distribution (in the <CODE>toolkit</CODE>
directory).

<P>If you get lost, you can always download the
<A HREF="notices_40source.html">complete &xwp; source code</A>,
where you will find the source code for the standard plug-in DLLs which come
with &xwp; (the window list and the clock and memory monitors), which show
you in detail how it's done.
