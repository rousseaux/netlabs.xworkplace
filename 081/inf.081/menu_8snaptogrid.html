        The "Snap to Grid" Feature
    </TITLE>

<!-- Changes in V0.81: see notes below -->
<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: see notes below -->
<BODY>
<!-- V0.9.0: add the following line -->
<B>Class: XFolder</B><HR>
XFolder can add a "Snap to grid" menu item to all folder context menus. When selecting it,
all objects in the folder will "jump" onto an invisible grid.

<P>The "Snap to grid" feature is a bit hard to explain. Just think of a folder whose
objects are pretty messed up: how many times have you found yourself trying to align those
objects below or next to each other?
<BR><IMG SRC="snap1.gif">
<P>The "Arrange" menu item doesn't help here, since it
reorders the objects completely. Now imagine a set of invisible equidistant lines
spread over the folder window, which attract
the objects therein when you select "Snap to grid".
<BR><IMG SRC="snap2.gif">

<P>The "Snap to grid" menu item will only be visible when the following applies:
<OL><LI>the folder must be open;
<BR><LI>the folder must have the no-grid icon view (the default for most folders);
it will not be visible for folders in details or tree view
or if you have changed the icon view to "flowed" or "non-flowed" in the folder's settings
dialog;
<BR><LI>the folder must not have the "Always maintain sort order" setting enabled.

<!-- this paragraph modified with V0.81 -->
</OL>You can specify the grid's origin and spacing on the "Grid" page in the new
<A HREF="sys_2global.html">"Workplace Shell" object</A>.

<!-- this paragraph added with V0.81 -->
<P><B>Note:</B> With V0.81, the "Snap to grid" behavior has changed slightly. Per default,
XFolder will only let the currently <B>selected</B> objects snap on the grid. However, if
you hold down the <B>Shift</B> key while selecting that menu item, all items will be
snapped (like in previous versions).
