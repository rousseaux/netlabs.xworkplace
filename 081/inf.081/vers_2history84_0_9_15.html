<B>&xwp; 0.9.15 (September 19, 2001)</B>

<P>This is an interim release for the IBM Warp Community Workshop,
September 17 to 21, 2001, Heidelberg, Germany.

<P>New features:

<UL><LI>xfix: Added "Select by name" function.

</UL>Miscellaneous changes:

<UL><LI>Resolved a couple of problems in the "WPS class list" display... things that
were supposed to be working a long time ago but didn't, such as gray display for classes
that were replaced and automatic expansion of the tree for those classes too.

</UL>Bugfixes:

<UL><LI>&pgr;: Fixed sporadic hangs and blocks that occurred unreproducably, but
reliably from time to time. It appears that the problems have been fixed for good.

<P><LI>Hook: Animation for "Move pointer to default push button" left circles on
the screen in many cases; somewhat fixed, although not completely.

</UL>
