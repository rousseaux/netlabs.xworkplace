<!-- This is all new with V0.9.4. -->
<BODY>
Starting with V0.9.4, &xwp; allows you to define a "default document" for a folder.

<P>Default documents are initially disabled. Go to the "View" page of the
<A HREF="sys_2global.html">"Workplace Shell" object</A> to enable them.

<P>If default documents are enabled, this will have two consequences:

<OL><LI>All <B>data files</B> will get a new context menu item called "Default document".
This item allows you to make a data file the default document of its folder.

<P><LI>If such a default document has been set for a folder, that <B>folder</B> will have a
new menu item in its "Open" context submenu which allows you to open that default document directly.
Note the difference: the <I>folder</I> context menu item opens the <I>data file.</I>
This is useful for folders which have a "main" file which is frequently opened in order
to avoid having to open the entire folder just to access that one document all the time.

</OL>In addition, you can even tell &xwp; to automatically make that default
document the <B>folder's default view.</B> If this is also enabled on the "View" page of the
<A HREF="sys_2global.html">"Workplace Shell" object,</A> the default <I>document</I> will
be opened if you double-click on the <I>folder</I> icon.

<P>If you don't want this to be the standard behavior for all folders which have default
documents, you can always set the default view of an individual folder to the "default document"
view on the "Menu" page of the folder's settings notebook.

<P>Here's an <B>example:</B> Say you have a folder with 300 HTML files. Opening the folder
just to access the <CODE>index.html</CODE> file is really tiresome because this takes some
time, and you really only want to access the <CODE>index.html</CODE> file.

<P>So open the folder once, open the context menu of <CODE>index.html</CODE>, select
"Default document", and you can simply double-click on the folder to have <CODE>index.html</CODE>
opened from now on.
