<BODY>
Typically, the following &link_peer; services will be started on your system:

<UL><LI>The <CODE>REQUESTER</CODE> service allows your computer to
see other resources on the LAN. The "requester" is a synonym for "client",
really. After the requester has been started, you can access remote
files and printers on the LAN. In addition, you can assign directories
that are shared by other computers to a driver letter on your own system.

<P><LI>The <CODE>PEER</CODE> service is a stripped-down version
of the server services that are only part of server versions of
&os2;. After the peer service has started, your computer can share
local directories, files, and printers with other computers on the
LAN.

<P>This service requires that the <CODE>REQUESTER</CODE> service
is active too.

</UL>Use a <A HREF="glossary/gls_cmd.html">command prompt</A> for dealing
with services in detail:

<UL><LI>To start a service explicitly, use
<CODE>NET START <I>service</I></CODE>, for example, <CODE>NET START REQUESTER</CODE>.

<P><LI>To stop a service explicitly, use
<CODE>NET STOP <I>service</I></CODE>, for example, <CODE>NET STOP REQUESTER</CODE>.

<P><LI>To find out which services are currently running, type
<CODE>NET START</CODE>, without a service name.

</UL>
