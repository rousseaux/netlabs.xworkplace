
The "049" directory tree contains all National Language Support (NLS)
files for complete German NLS.

The "liesmich" and "liesmich.nls" files are for the XWorkplace distribution
and will go into the WarpIN install script. "liesmich.nls" is displayed
by WarpIN when the NLS archive is opened directly.

See PROGREF.INF for details about NLS and translating XWorkplace.
