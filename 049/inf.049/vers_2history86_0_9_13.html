<B>&xwp; 0.9.13 (July 6, 2001)</B>
 
<P>New features:
 
<UL><LI>&xcenter;: Added tray widgets, per popular request. Drag'n'drop doesn't
quite work yet though.
<P><LI>&xcenter;: Added "Spacing lines" setting to &xcenter; view styles.
<P><LI>&xcenter;: Added drop support and in-use emphasis to object button widgets.
<P><LI>&xcenter;: Added detailed system information to tooltips for pulse and sentinel
widgets.
<P><LI>OS/2 Kernel: Added new &cfgsys; memory settings to "Memory" page.
<P><LI>OS/2 Kernel: Added support for driver dialog Plug-In DLLs. Configuration
dialogs can now be added as Plug-In DLL to the plugins\drvdlgs directory without
having to modify the XWorkplace sources.
<P><LI>OS/2 Kernel: Added a new JFS.IFS dialog while I was at it.
 
</UL><P>Miscellaneous changes:
 
<UL><LI>General: All XWP message boxes now use the new shared code that was
developed for WarpIN. Looks a bit nicer, in my view.
<P><LI>General: Did quite a major overhaul of the documentation. Much information
was moved from the User Guide to the various help pages that appear if you press
"Help" in an object settings notebook. I find this more helpful because then the
help is in the context of what you're doing. Also added more general explanations
of some OS/2 and WPS concepts to the help file.
<P><LI>Removed the temporary archive marker file that was previously used to check
for whether a WPS archive was just restored. Thanks, Stefan Milcke.
<P><LI>"Sort" menu: Per popular request, the menu is dismissed again, unless shift
is held down while clicking or "always sort" or "folders first" were clicked on.
<P><LI>"Multimedia" object: Device detection on page 1 was completely rewritten.
Hopefully this fixes the system hangs some people experienced with buggy multimedia
drivers. While I was at it, I added lots of information to the display.
<P><LI>Font sample view: default window size was a bit small. Fixed, now using almost
the whole screen.
<P><LI>&xcenter;: Made some xwplog.log messages more verbose.
 
</UL>Bugfixes:
 
<UL><LI>General: Added lots of new checks for audio CDs in the library code. This should
finally prevent the stupid white error boxes on Desktop startup, with the status bars
in the "Drives" folder, and on disk double-clicks if an audio CD was inserted in a
CD-ROM drive.
<P><LI>General: Replaced internal binary tree implementation with a new one. The old
one proved to balance wrongly if a certain tree size was reached. This should fix the
"Object count mismatch" messages in xwplog.log on shutdown, among other things.
<P><LI>"Sort" menu: Fixed confusion with check marks in certain situations.
<P><LI>&xcenter;: "Add widget" menu never worked with sliding menus enabled. Fixed.
<P><LI>&xcenter;: Paul Ratcliffe fixed the context menu font.
<P><LI>&xcenter;: Fixed a memory leak on widget destruction.
<P><LI>&xcenter;: Tooltips weren't managed properly for widgets that were just created
or destroyed by the user. Fixed.
<P><LI>&xcenter;: Fixed minor pointer change problem while settings dialog was displayed.
<P><LI>System sounds: Changes in 0.9.13 caused &winos2; to complain that sound device
was busy. Fixed, hopefully.
<P><LI>"Snap to grid" page: Values for Y origin and Y spacing were confused. Fixed.
<P><LI>Boot logos: "Undo" button on "Startup" page in desktop's settings notebook
never restored the boot logo file setting, which could lead to trouble if your boss
came into the office. Fixed; thanks, Steve Wendt, for pointing this out.
<P><LI>&xshutdown;: daemon crashed during shutdown if hook wasn't active. Fixed.
<P><LI>&xshutdown;: 0.9.12 code broke WM_SAVEAPPLICATION behavior for some apps. Fixed;
went back to pre-0.9.12 code there.
<P><LI>&xshutdown;: Shutdown thread kept marching even if an exception was currently
being processed on another thread, which prevented the trap logs from being written.
Fixed, shutdown thread is now waiting if an exception handler is running somewhere.
<P><LI>&xshutdown;: Shutdown folder carried "Startup folder" in its progress window
title. Fixed.
