default view. Bug 1193 [rw]

<P><LI>If the Desktop's default view were changed, it couldn't be reset to
Icon view. [rw]

<P><LI>The 'File attributes' submenu didn't work when accessed from a folder
menubar's 'Selected' dropdown. [rw]

<P><LI>'File attributes' and 'Copy filename' now work for menus popped-up
by other WPS add-ons (e.g. Object Desktop or Dragtext). [rw]

<P><LI>Sorting non-file objects by a file-system criterion (e.g. size) left
them in no order;  they are now grouped and sorted by title. [rw]

treated as names, not extensions. [rw]

<P><LI>When a Splitview window first opened, subfolders in the Tree window
failed to show a '+' next to them. [rw]

<P><LI>To ease drag-and-drop in Splitview windows, you can now drop objects
between existing objects;  also, MB2-down no longer brings the window to the
top. [rw]

<P><LI>Splitview now displays folder menus and statusbars based on your
global settings, and not the settings for the folder you've opened. [rw]

<P><LI>Many items in Splitview's 'View' and 'Selected' menus didn't do
anything;  all items in the menubar should now work as expected. [rw]

<P><LI>Trashcan can now be opened in Splitview. [rw]

<P><LI>XFix has been thoroughly revised to make it safer and easier to
use. File handles are no longer deleted immediately but are marked for
later deletion.  Handles that would become invalid if another handle is
deleted are flagged so the problem can be corrected. A new "Auto-Protect"
feature prevents you from accidentally deleting handles the WPS needs to
operate. The help entries for xfix have also been rewritten.

<P><LI>Numerous changes have been made to streamline the build system
and fix minor errors. [rw]
