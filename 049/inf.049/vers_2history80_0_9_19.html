<B>&xwp; 0.9.19 (July 2, 2002)</B>

<P>New features:

<UL><LI>Icon page: Implemented keyboard support for editing the object ID.

<P><LI>Folders: "Select by name" dialog supports regular expressions now.

<P><LI>Folders: Added "Rename objects" folder context menu item for batch
renaming.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Added "IP monitor" widget.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: X-Button widget now opens its menu when &xcenter; object
hotkey is pressed.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: X-Button widget supports user bitmaps now (open properties
to set them).

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Per default, an &xcenter; makes itself a screen border object
automatically now. This can be disabled in the settings notebook.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Widget context menus have "Close" menu item now.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: WIDGETS setup strings supports trays now. It is finally
possible to set up a complete XCenter via setup strings. Note that the
format has slightly changed; see the help for the object "Details" button
on the "Icon" page for details. Changed the default XCenter setup while
I was at it.

<P><LI>&os2; Kernel: Added a couple more SYSLEVEL files.

<P><LI>Hook: Added "Center over button-less dialogs" to
auto-move pointer feature (Martin Lafaix).

<P><LI>&pgr;: Reworked pager window display to allow for shaded colors in
background and showing the program icons as well.

<P><LI>&pgr;: Sticky window criteria are now much better; "Undo" works now too
(Martin Lafaix). Also included regular expressions support.

<P><LI>&pgr;: Pager window can now paint sticky and secondary windows too
(Martin Lafaix).

<P><LI>&pgr;: "Desktop follows focus" can now be disabled, for so many people
didn't like this behavior.

<P><LI>NetscapeDDE: uses default browser settings from WPUrl object now,
if not overridden from the command line (Yuri Dario).

</UL>Miscellaneous changes:

<UL><LI>Common: Added better error messages for some error codes.

<P><LI>Common: Found a way to give dialog windows a close button too.

<P><LI>Startup: Much more detailed startup log which might help debugging WPS
startup problems. Changed log file name to WPSTART.LOG.

<P><LI>Config folders: The restriction that shadows to program objects
in the config folders were not treated like program objects (for the special
program object features) has been lifted. It is no longer necessary to copy
program objects for that reason.

<P><LI>Folder content menus: folder templates are no longer sorted with the
other folders.

<P><LI>File page replacement: rewritten, it's now sizeable too.

<P><LI>File operations: Removed global "Replace true delete" setting. Added
a checkbox to trash can instead.

<P><LI>File operations: Reversed confirmations for "move to trash" and
"empty trash". The real delete operation is to move something to the trash can;
it really doesn't make sense to have every object confirmed when the trash can
is emptied later.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Single click on empty space in tray widget will change trays now.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Made Diskfree (WarpCenter style) widget sizeable to avoid
the permanent resizing.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Rewrote large parts of the window list widget, which no longer
scans the window list itself, but uses XWPDAEMN.EXE instead. For one, this
allows sharing the window list code between &pgr; and the window list widget;
most importantly though, the window list no longer blocks the PM SIQ if a
window doesn't care to respond to WM_QUERYICON. Added
half-toned display for minimized and hidden windows as well.

<P><LI>&xshutdown;: We no longer recover Windows to the current desktop and run the
shutdown folder for "restart Desktop", but only for actual system shutdown.

<P><LI>&pgr;: The remaining parts of PageMage were rewritten. There is now no
legacy PageMage code left in &pgr;. Optimized window list scanning to use an
additional background thread and to allow sharing the window list with the
&xcenter; window list widget.

</UL>Bugfixes:

<UL><LI>Common: Some internal initialization code didn't get called for folders,
which was the reason why renaming them neither refreshed their container record
nor awake shadows properly. Fixed.

<P><LI>Common: Fixed global variables which caused many dialogs to fail after
NLS change. Also localized a few more hard-coded strings.

<P><LI>Common: If NLS DLL cannot be found, &xwp; will automatically
fall back to English NLS now. Of course this doesn't work if English
is broken, but then &xwp; is hosed anyway.

<P><LI>Common: Lots of rework on dialog manager to fix display oddities on
resolutions lower than 1024x768. Hopefully this didn't break anything.

<P><LI>Common: Fixed tooltips that would frequently not appear (Yuri Dario).

<P><LI>Common: Added help to some &xwp; message boxes.

<P><LI>Icon page replacement: didn't allow empty object titles, which is
allowed in the WPS. Fixed.

<P><LI>Programs: Now using XWPDAEMN.EXE for starting programs, which should help
with applications hanging the system.

<P><LI>Programs: Selecting "Cancel" in parameters prompt provoked a cryptic error
message. Fixed.

<P><LI>Programs: Added a missing mutex semaphore which might have caused hangs
during WPS startup or later when program data was changed.

<P><LI>Folder status bars: Finally fixed status bars for those Object Desktop
classes that shouldn't have any.

<P><LI>Folder status bars: Fixed garbage display if more than 4 GB of files
were selected in a folder.

<P><LI>Folders: "Select by name" never worked right from "Edit" pulldown menu
if any files were selected in the folder view. Fixed.

<P><LI>Folders: Opening settings notebook could take ages if turbo folders were off.
Fixed.

<P><LI>Folders: Details views weren't refresh properly during refresh. Fixed.

<P><LI>Folders: Turbo folders had a few situations where real name
changes weren't picked up properly, leading to duplicate or misnamed
objects. Among other things, this could affect objects when the
"Title clash" dialog popped up. Fixed.

<P><LI>Folder auto-refresh: Fixed a couple cases where refresh notifications
were confused.

<P><LI>Folder content menus: Text wasn't centered vertically with icons, fixed
(Martin Lafaix).

<P><LI>Turbo folders: Fixed wrong icons for FTP-PM and other WPProgram subclasses.
Also fixed wrong association icons for WPUrl objects.

<P><LI>File operations: True delete replacement never worked if trash can was
disabled. Fixed.

<P><LI>File operations: Title clash dialog no longer appears when creating shadows.

<P><LI>File operations: Trash can crashed when deleting several objects with the
same title. Fixed.

<P><LI>File dialog replacement: Double-clicking on object in right container didn't
work. Fixed.

<P><LI>Fonts folder: Installing fonts via drag and drop crashed the WPS internally.
I'm not sure if the bug was in 0.9.18 or if I introduced it later, but it's
working now anyway.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Largely rewrote widget creation and drag-n-drop code to handle
dragging widgets between &xcenter;s, including trays. Apparently this also
fixed malpositioned widgets in some situations.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Object button and X-button widgets crashed PM bad when objects
from other processes were dragged over them. Fixed.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Object buttons would frequently not repaint correctly when
hatching was supposed to disappear. Fixed.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Double-clicking on clock widget didn't quite open eCSClock
correctly. Fixed.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Finally saves its height between restarts (Martin Lafaix).

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Object button content menus behaved strange when &xcenter; border
spacing was set to zero and the object button was at the very left of the &xcenter;.
Fixed.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Some rework on DiskFree (WarpCenter style) widget (Yuri Dario).

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Battery widget displayed wrong power source when battery was
fully charged on some systems. Fixed, hopefully.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Fixed occasional zombie entries in system window list.

<P><LI>&xcenter;: Crash while processing a timer would never release a private
timer mutex, leading to system hangs. Fixed.

<P><LI>XWPSetup: "Create object" buttons produced empty titles for some classes. Fixed.

<P><LI>&xshutdown;: Fixed INI saving errors with empty applications in profiles
(Paul Ratcliffe).

<P><LI>Hook: Fixed major screwups if screen border objects were opened during
startup or shutdown.

<P><LI>Hook: Pre-populate caused &pgr; to no longer detect the WPS desktop. Fixed.

<P><LI>Hook: Fixed a race which caused &pgr; to ignore the WPS desktop in certain
conditions as well.

<P><LI>Hook: Sliding focus never worked right with Mozilla subwindows such as
menus. Fixed.

<P><LI>Hook: "Function keys" page crashed if there were no function keys. Fixed.

<P><LI>xfix: Fixed crashes with some broken handles situations (Paul Ratcliffe).
