/*
 *@@ HackSwitchList:
 *      subclasses the PM window list, or undoes subclassing.
 *
 *      This is a truly evil hack. Simply running WinSubclassWindow
 *      on the switch list doesn't work for two reasons:
 *
 *      1)  The caller must be on the same process as the window.
 *          This is hard to do with the switch list because it
 *          is created by the Shell process (first PMSHELL).
 *
 *          This is why initHook now sends a very strange user
 *          message to the switch list so that hookSendMsgHook
 *          can detect that (hopefully it is really unique) and
 *          run this code in the Shell process.
 *
 *      2)  Instead of WinSubclassWindow, we simply run
 *          WinSetWindowPtr(QWP_PFNWP) on the switch list. From
 *          my testing, that function doesn't perform as many
 *          checks which is why it works on the switch list too.
 *
 *          Still, for QWP_PFNWP, WinSetWindowPtr appears to
 *          check if the processes of the caller and the window's
 *          queue match. Since, for some reason, the shell's
 *          queue has a PID of 0, we need to actually modify
 *          the queue's memory for a second. Yes, very evil.
 *
 *      May run on the Shell process only.
