 *@@sourcefile xwphook.c:
 *      this has the all the code for XWPHOOK.DLL, which implements
 *      all the XWorkplace PM system hooks, as well as a few exported
 *      interface functions which may only be called by the XWorkplace
 *      daemon process (XWPDAEMN.EXE).
 *
 *      There are four hooks at present:
 *      -- hookSendMsgHook
 *      -- hookLockupHook
 *      -- hookInputHook
 *      -- hookPreAccelHook
 *      See the remarks in the respective functions.
 *
 *      Most of the hook features started out with code taken
 *      from ProgramCommander/2 and WarpEnhancer and were then
 *      extended.
 *
 *      I have tried to design the hooks for clarity and lucidity with
 *      respect to interfaces and configuration --
 *      as if that was possible with system hooks at all, since they
 *      are so messy by nature.
 *
 *      XWorkplace implementation notes:
 *
 *      --  System hooks are possibly running in the context of each PM
 *          thread which is processing a message -- that is, possibly each
 *          thread on the system which has created a message queue.
 *
 *          As a result, great care must be taken when accessing global
 *          data, and one must keep in mind for each function which thread
 *          it might run in, or otherwise we'd be asking for system hangs.
 *          Don't expect OS/2 to handle exceptions correctly if all PM
 *          programs crash at the same time.
 *
 *          It _is_ possible to access static global variables of
 *          this DLL from every function, because the DLL is linked
 *          with the STATIC SHARED flags (see xwphook.def).
 *          This means that the single data segment of the DLL becomes
 *          part of each process which is using the DLL
 *          (that is, each PM process on the system). We use this
 *          for the HOOKDATA structure, which is a static global structure
 *          in the DLL's shared data segment and is returned to the daemon
 *          when it calls hookInit in the DLL.
 *
 *          HOOKDATA includes a HOOKCONFIG structure. As a result, to
 *          configure the basic hook flags, the daemon can simply
 *          modify the fields in the HOOKDATA structure to configure
 *          the hook's behavior.
 *
 *          It is however _not_ possible to use malloc() to allocate global
 *          memory and use it between several calls of the hooks, because
 *          that memory will belong to one process only, even if the pointer
 *          is stored in a global DLL variable. The next time the hook gets
 *          called and accesses that memory, some fairly random application
 *          will crash (the one the hook is currently called for), or the
 *          system will hang completely.
 *
 *          For this reason, the hooks use another block of shared memory
 *          internally, which is protected by a mutex semaphore, for storing
 *          the list of object hotkeys (which is variable in size).
 *          This block is (re)allocated in hookSetGlobalHotkeys and
 *          requested in the hook when WM_CHAR comes in. The mutex is
 *          necessary because when hotkeys are changed, the daemon changes
 *          the structure by calling hookSetGlobalHotkeys.
 *
 *      --  The exported hook* functions may only be used by one
 *          single process. It is not possible for one process to
 *          call hookInit and for another to call another hook*
 *          function, because the shared memory which is allocated
 *          here must be "owned" by a certain process and would not be
 *          properly freed if several processes called the hook
 *          interfaces.
 *
 *          So, per definition, it is only the XWorkplace daemon's
 *          (XWPDAEMN.EXE) responsibility to interface and configure
 *          the hook. Theoretically, we could have done this from
 *          XFLDR.DLL in PMSHELL.EXE also, but using the daemon has a
 *          number of advantages to that, since it can be terminated
 *          and restarted independently of the WPS (see xwpdaemn.c
 *          for details). Also, if something goes wrong, it's only
 *          the daemon which crashes, and not the entire WPS.
 *
 *          When any configuration data changes which is of importance
 *          to the hook, XFLDR.DLL writes this data to OS2.INI and
 *          then posts the daemon a message. The daemon then reads
 *          the new data and notifies the hook thru defined interface
 *          functions. All configuration structures are declared in
 *          xwphook.h.

 *      If we wish to change any of the keys configurations,

 *      by the hook. If previous such blocks exist, they
 *      are freed and reallocated. Access to those blocks
 *      is protected by a mutex semaphore internally in case

 *@@ WMMouseMove_SlidingFocus:
 *      this gets called when hookInputHook intercepts
 *      WM_MOUSEMOVE to do the "sliding focus" processing.
 *
 *      This function evaluates hwnd to find out whether
 *      the mouse has moved over a new frame window.
 *      If so, XDM_SLIDINGFOCUS is posted to the daemon's
 *      object window, which will then do the actual focus
 *      and active window processing (starting a timer, if
 *      delayed focus is active).
 *
 *      Processing is fairly complicated because special
 *      case checks are needed for certain window classes
 *      (combo boxes, Win-OS/2 windows). Basically, this
 *      function finds the frame window to which hwnd
 *      (the window under the mouse, from the hook) belongs
 *      and passes that frame to the daemon. If another
 *      frame is found between the main frame and hwnd,
 *      that frame is passed to the daemon also.
 *
 *      Frame activation is then not done from the hook, but
 *      from the daemon instead.
 *
 *      Inspired by code from ProgramCommander (W) Roman Stangl.
 *      Fixed a few problems with MDI frames.

/*
 *@@ WMMouseMove_SlidingMenus:
 *      this gets called when hookInputHook intercepts
 *      WM_MOUSEMOVE and the window under the mouse is
 *      a menu control to do automatic menu selection.
 *
 *      This implementation is slightly tricky. ;-)
 *      We cannot query the MENUITEM data of a menu
 *      which does not belong to the calling process
 *      because this message needs access to the caller's
 *      storage. I have tried this, this causes every
 *      application to crash as soon as a menu item
 *      gets selected.
 *
 *      Fortunately, Roman Stangl has found a cool way
 *      of doing this, so I could build on that.
 *
 *      So now we start a timer in the daemon which will
 *      post a special WM_MOUSEMOVE message back to us
 *      which can only be received by us
 *      (with the same HWND and MP1 as the original
 *      WM_MOUSEMOVE, but a special flag in MP2). When
 *      that special message comes in, we can select
 *      the menu item.
 *
 *      In addition to Roman's code, we always change the
 *      MIA_HILITE attribute of the current menu item
 *      under the mouse, so the menu hilite follows the
 *      mouse immediately, even though submenus may be
 *      opened delayed.
 *
 *      We return TRUE if the msg is to be swallowed.
 *
 *      Inspired by code from ProgramCommander (W) Roman Stangl.

/*
 *@@ hookInputHook:
 *      Input queue hook. According to PMREF, this hook gets
 *      called just before the system returns from a WinGetMsg
 *      or WinPeekMsg call -- so this does _not_ get called as
 *      a result of WinPostMsg, but before the msg is _retrieved_.
 *
 *      However, only _posted_ messages go thru this hook. _Sent_
 *      messages never get here; there is a separate hook type
 *      for that.
 *
 *      This implements the XWorkplace mouse features such as
 *      hot corners, sliding focus, mouse-button-3 scrolling etc.
 *
 *      Note: WM_CHAR messages (hotkeys) are not processed here,
 *      but rather in hookPreAccelHook, which gets called even
 *      before this hook. See remarks there.
 *
 *      We return TRUE if the message is to be swallowed, or FALSE
 *      if the current application (or the next hook in the hook
 *      chain) should still receive the message.
 *
 *      I have tried to keep the actual hook function as short as
 *      possible. Several separate subfunctions have been extracted
 *      which only get called if the respective functionality is
 *      actually needed (depending on the message and whether the
 *      respective feature has been enabled), both for clarity and
 *      speed. This is faster because the hook function gets called
 *      thousands of times (for every posted message...), and this
 *      way it is more likely that the hook code can completely remain
 *      in the processor caches all the time when lots of messages are
 *      processed.

/*
 *@@ WMChar_Hotkeys:
 *      this gets called from hookPreAccelHook to
 *      process WM_CHAR messages.
 *
 *      As opposed to folder hotkeys (folder.c),
 *      for the global object hotkeys, we need a more
 *      sophisticated processing, because we cannot rely
 *      on the usch field, which is different between
 *      PM and VIO sessions (apparently the translation
 *      is taking place differently for VIO sessions).
 *
 *      As a result, we can only use the scan code to
 *      identify hotkeys. See GLOBALHOTKEY for details.
 *
 *      Since we use a dynamically allocated array of
 *      GLOBALHOTKEY structures, to make this thread-safe,
 *      we have to use shared memory and a global mutex
 *      semaphore. See hookSetGlobalHotkeys. While this
 *      function is being called, the global mutex is
 *      requested, so this is protected.
 *
 *      If this returns TRUE, the msg is swallowed. We
 *      return TRUE if we found a hotkey.
 *
 *      This function gets called for BOTH the key-down and
 *      the key-up message. As usual with PM, applications
 *      should react to key-down messages only. However, since
 *      we swallow the key-down message if a hotkey was found
 *      (and post XDM_HOTKEYPRESSED to the daemon object window),

/*
 *@@ hookPreAccelHook:
 *      this is the pre-accelerator-table hook. Like
 *      hookInputHook, this gets called when messages
 *      are coming in from the system input queue, but
 *      as opposed to a "regular" input hook, this hook
 *      gets called even before translation from accelerator
 *      tables occurs.
 *
 *      Pre-accel hooks are not documented in the PM Reference.
 *      I have found this idea (and part of the implementation)
 *      in the source code of ProgramCommander/2, so thanks
 *      go out (once again) to Roman Stangl.
 *
 *      In this hook, we check for the global object hotkeys
 *      so that we can use certain key combinations regardless
 *      of whether they might be currently used in application
 *      accelerator tables. This is especially useful for
 *      "Alt" key combinations, which are usually intercepted
 *      when menus have corresponding shortcuts.
 *
 *      As a result, as opposed to other hotkey software you
 *      might know, XWorkplace does properly react to "Ctrl+Alt"
 *      keyboard combinations, even if a menu would get called
 *      with the "Alt" key. ;-)
 *
 *      As with hookInputHook, we return TRUE if the message is
 *      to be swallowed, or FALSE if the current application (or
 *      the next hook in the hook chain) should still receive the
 *      message.
 *
