
src\filesys has "file-system" code in the broadest
sense, i.e. everything that has to do with stuff
in the file system. This includes implementation
code for folders, data files, program files, as
well as the additional XWorkplace threads.

Most of this code gets called from the SOM class
code in src\classes.

All this code goes into XFLDR.DLL.
