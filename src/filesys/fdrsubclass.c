 *@@sourcefile fdrsubclass.c:
 *      this file is ALL new with V0.9.3 and now implements
 *      folder frame subclassing, which has been largely
 *      redesigned with V0.9.3.
 *
 *      XWorkplace subclasses all WPFolder frame windows to
 *      intercept a large number of messages. This is needed
 *      for the majority of XWorkplace's features, which are
 *      not directly SOM/WPS-related, but are rather straight
 *      PM programming.
 *
 *      Most of the standard WPS methods are really encapsulations
 *      of PM messages. When the WPS opens a folder window, it
 *      creates a container control as a child of the folder frame
 *      window (with the id FID_CLIENT), which is subclassed to
 *      get all the container WM_CONTROL messages. Then, for
 *      example, if the user opens a context menu on an object
 *      in the container, the frame gets WM_CONTROL with
 *      CN_CONTEXTMENU. The WPS then finds the WPS (SOM) object
 *      which corresponds to the container record core on which
 *      the context menu was opened and invokes the WPS menu
 *      methods on it, that is, wpFilterPopupMenu and
 *      wpModifyPopupMenu. Similar things happen with WM_COMMAND
 *      and wpMenuItemSelected.
 *
 *      The trick is just how to get "past" the WPS, which does
 *      a lot of hidden stuff in its method code. By subclassing
 *      the folder frames ourselves, we get all the messages which
 *      are being sent or posted to the folder _before_ the WPS
 *      gets them and can thus modify the WPS's behavior even if
 *      no methods have been defined for a certain event. An
 *      example of this is that the contents of an XFolder status
 *      bar changes when object selections have changed in the
 *      folder: this reacts to WM_CONTROL with CN_EMPHASIS.
 *
 *      Subclassing is done in XFolder::wpOpen after having called
 *      the parent method (WPFolder's), which returns the handle
 *      of the new folder frame which the WPS has created.
 *      XFolder::wpOpen calls fdrManipulateNewView for doing this.
 *
 *      XFolder's subclassed frame window proc is called
 *      fnwpSubclWPFolderWindow. Take a look at it, it's one of
 *      the most interesting parts of XWorkplace. It handles status
 *      bars (which are frame controls), tree view auto-scrolling,
 *      special menu features, the "folder content" menus and more.
 *
 *      This gives us the following hierarchy of window procedures:
 *
 *      1. our fnwpSubclWPFolderWindow, first, followed by
 *
 *      2. the WPS folder frame window subclass, followed by
 *
 *      3. WC_FRAME's default frame window procedure, followed by
 *
 *      4. WinDefWindowProc last.
 *
 *      If additional WPS enhancers are installed (e.g. Object
 *      Desktop), they will appear at the top of the chain also.
 *      I guess it depends on the hierarchy of replacement classes
 *      in the WPS class list which one sits on top.
 *
 *      While we had an ugly global linked list of subclassed
 *      folder views in all XFolder and XWorkplace versions
 *      before V0.9.3, I have finally (after two years...)
 *      found a more elegant way of storing folder data. The
 *      secret is simply re-registing the folder view window
 *      class ("wpFolder window"), which is initially registered
 *      by the WPS somehow. No more global variables and mutex
 *      semaphores...
 *
 *      This hopefully fixes most folder serialization problems
 *      which have occured with previous XFolder/XWorkplace versions.
 *
 *      Since I was unable to find out where WinRegisterClass
 *      gets called from in the WPS, I have implemented a local
 *      send-message hook for PMSHELL.EXE only which re-registers
 *      that window class again when the first WM_CREATE for a
 *      folder view comes in. See fdr_SendMsgHook. Basically,
 *      this adds more bytes for the window words so we can store
 *      a SUBCLFOLDERVIEW structure for each folder view in
 *      the window words, instead of having to maintain a global
 *      linked list.
 *
 *      When a folder view is subclassed (during XFolder::wpOpen
 *      processing) by fdrSubclassFolderView, a SUBCLFOLDERVIEW is
 *      created and stored in the new window words. Appears to
 *      work fine so far.

 *
 *      This stores the SFV pointer in the frame's window

 *          This is needed for file operations on all selected
 *          objects in the container. We call wpshQuerySourceObject
 *          to find out more about this and store the result in
 *          our SUBCLFOLDERVIEW.
 *
 *          Note that we must ONLY change the source object if
 *          the menu ID is something we recognize as either
 *          the main context menu or the folder menu bar pulldowns.
 *          We get WM_INIMENU for submenus too, and we must
 *          not change the source object then.
 *
 *      2)  for folder content menus, because these are
 *          inserted as empty stubs only in wpModifyPopupMenu
 *          and only filled after the user clicks on them.
 *          We will query a bunch of data first, which we need
 *          later for drawing our items, and then call
 *          mnuFillContentSubmenu, which populates the folder
 *          and fills the menu with the items therein.
 *
 *      3)  for the menu system sounds.
 *
 *      4)  for manipulating Warp 4 folder menu _bars_. We
 *          cannot use the Warp 4 WPS methods defined for
 *          that because we want XWorkplace to run on Warp 3
 *          also.
 *
 *      WM_INITMENU parameters:
 *          SHORT mp1   menu item id
 *          HWND  mp2   menu window handle
 *      Returns: NULL always.

        The following list defines the OWNERITEM data structure fields as they apply to the
        container control. See OWNERITEM for the default field values.

        hwnd (HWND)
                 Handle of the window in which ownerdraw will occur. The following is a list
                 of the window handles that can be specified for ownerdraw:

                     The container window handle of the icon, name, text, and tree views
                     The container title window handle
                     The left or right window handles of the details view
                     The left or right column heading windows of the details view.

        hps (HPS)
                 Handle of the presentation space of the container window. For the details
                 view that uses a split bar, the presentation space handle is either for the
                 left or right window, depending upon the position of the column. If the
                 details view does not have a split bar, the presentation space handle is for
                 the left window.

        fsState (ULONG)
                 Specifies emphasis flags. This state is not used by the container control
                 because the application is responsible for drawing the emphasis states
                 during ownerdraw.

        fsAttribute (ULONG)
                 Attributes of the record as given in the flRecordAttr field in the
                 RECORDCORE data structure.

        fsStateOld (ULONG)
                 Previous emphasis. This state is not used by the container control because
                 the application is responsible for drawing the emphasis states during
                 ownerdraw.

        fsAttributeOld (ULONG)
                 Previous attribute. This state is not used by the container control because
                 the application is responsible for drawing the emphasis states during
                 ownerdraw.

        rclItem (RECTL)
                 This is the bounding rectangle into which the container item is drawn.

                 If the container item is an icon/text or bit-map/text pair, two
                 WM_DRAWITEM messages are sent to the application. The first
                 WM_DRAWITEM message contains the rectangle bounding the icon or bit map
                 and the second contains the rectangle bounding the text.

                 If the container item contains only text, or only an icon or bit map, only
                 one WM_DRAWITEM message is sent. However, if the current view is the
                 tree icon or tree text view and if the item is a parent item, the application
                 will receive an additional WM_DRAWITEM (in Container Controls) message.
                 The additional message is for the icon or bit map that indicates whether the
                 parent item is expanded or collapsed.

                 If the current view is the details view and the CFA_OWNER attribute is set,
                 the rectangle's size is equal to the width of the column and the height of
                 the tallest field in the container item. CFA_OWNER is an attribute of the
                 FIELDINFO data structure's flData field.

        idItem (ULONG)
                 Identifies the item being drawn. It can be one of the following:

                     CMA_CNRTITLE
                     CMA_ICON
                     CMA_TEXT
                     CMA_TREEICON.

                 This field is not used for the details view and is set to 0.

        hItem (CNRDRAWITEMINFO)
                 Pointer to a CNRDRAWITEMINFO structure.

                 typedef struct _CNRDRAWITEMINFO {
                   PRECORDCORE     pRecord;     //  RECORDCORE structure for the record being drawn.
                   PFIELDINFO      pFieldInfo;  //  FIELDINFO structure for the container column
                                                // being drawn in the details view. This is only
                                                // != NULL if we're in details view.
                 } CNRDRAWITEMINFO;

 *@@ ProcessFolderMsgs:
 *      actual folder view message processing. Called
 *      from fnwpSubclWPFolderWindow. See remarks
 *      there.
 *
 *      This has been separated from fnwpSubclWPFolderWindow
 *      for split view (and file dialog) support. Those
 *      windows do not use fnwpSubclWPFolderWindow, but
 *      rather have their own window procs for the main
 *      frame and the left and right frames and would
 *      like to call this func explicitly.
 *
 *      This is maybe the most central (and most complex) part of
 *      XWorkplace. Since most WPS methods are really just reacting
 *      to messages in the default WPS frame window proc, but for
 *      some features methods are just not sufficient, basically we
 *      simulate what the WPS does here by intercepting _lots_
 *      of messages before the WPS gets them.
 *
 *      Unfortunately, this leads to quite a mess, but we have
 *      no choice.
 *
 *      Things we do in this proc:
 *
 *      --  frame control manipulation for status bars
 *
 *      --  Warp 4 folder menu bar manipulation (WM_INITMENU)
 *
 *      --  handling of certain menu items w/out dismissing
 *          the menu; this calls functions in fdrmenus.c
 *
 *      --  menu owner draw (folder content menus w/ icons);
 *          this calls functions in fdrmenus.c also
 *
 *      --  complete interception of file-operation menu items
 *          such as "delete" for deleting all objects into the
 *          XWorkplace trash can; this is now done thru a
 *          new method, which can be overridden by WPFolder
 *          subclasses (such as the trash can). See
 *          XFolder::xwpProcessViewCommand.
 *
 *      --  container control messages: tree view auto-scroll,
 *          updating status bars etc.
 *
 *      --  playing the new system sounds for menus and such.
 *
 *      Note that this function calls lots of "external" functions
 *      spread across all over the XWorkplace code. I have tried to
 *      reduce the size of this window procedure to an absolute
 *      minimum because this function gets called very often (for
 *      every single folder message) and large message procedures
 *      may thrash the processor caches.

 *      on subclassing the default WPS folder frames.
 *      Our custom views such as the file dialog and split views
 *      have their own subclassing mechanisms which call
 *      fdrProcessFolderMsgs directly. See the description there
 *      also for what this does for certain messages.
