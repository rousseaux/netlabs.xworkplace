 *@@sourcefile miniwdgt.c:
 *      code template for a minimal XCenter widget.
 *
 *      This is an example of an XCenter widget plugin.
 *      This code is compiled into a separate widget
 *      plugin DLL, which (as with all widget plugins)
 *      must be put into the plugins/xcenter directory
 *      of the XWorkplace installation directory.
 *
 *      This dummy widget only displays a small rectangle
 *      with a question mark. This can be taken as a
 *      template for implementing something more useful.
 *
 *      NOTE: This code is absolutely minimal. It cannot
 *
 *      -- display settings dialog;
 *
 *      -- display tooltips;
 *
 *      -- store any settings in a widget setup string.
 *
 *      If you want to use any of that, download the XWorkplace
 *      source code and look at the samples in the src\widgets
 *      directory, which are more complex, but more powerful
 *      as well.
 *
 *      Of course, you are free not to use this code and
 *      rewrite everything from scratch.
 *
 *      Any XCenter widget plugin DLL must export the
 *      following procedures by ordinal:
 *
 *      -- Ordinal 1 (WgtInitModule): this must
 *         return the widgets which this DLL provides.
 *
 *      -- Ordinal 2 (WgtUnInitModule): this must
 *         clean up global DLL data.
 *
 *      Unless you start your own threads in your widget,
 *      you can safely compile the widget with the VAC
 *      subsystem libraries to reduce the DLL's size.
 *      You can also import functions from XFLDR.DLL
 *      to avoid code duplication.
 *
 *      This is all new with V0.9.9.
