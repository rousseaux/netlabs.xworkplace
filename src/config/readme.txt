
src\config has various configuration code,
mostly notebook pages for the "OS/2 Kernel",
"Workplace Shell", "WPS Class List", "Screen"
objects.

All this code goes into XFLDR.DLL.

Note that many more settings pages are in the
"src\filesys" directory, if they are related
to the source code there.
