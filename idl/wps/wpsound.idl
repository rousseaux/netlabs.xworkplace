 * wpsound.idl:
 *      beefed up SOM interface description file for the
 *      following classes built into the WPS:
 *
 *      --  WPSound
 *
 *      XWorkplace uses this file instead of the respective
 *      file from whatever Toolkit you have installed to
 *      a) make SOM aware of our class replacements and
 *      b) allow us to override undocumented WPS methods.
 *      See idl\wps\readme.txt for details.
