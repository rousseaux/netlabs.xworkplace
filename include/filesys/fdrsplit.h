     *@@ SN_FRAMECLOSE:
     *      WM_CONTROL notification code posted (!) from the
     *      split view controller (fnwpSplitController)
     *      to its parent, the main frame, which should
     *      be subclassed to intercept this notification.
     *
     *      SHORT1FROMMP(mp1) is always FID_CLIENT.
     *
     *      This one gets posted (!) to the frame when the
     *      client receives WM_CLOSE. The problem
     *      that we have with the "close" processing
     *      is that we want to allow the frame to
     *      handle it, but the frame itself will never
     *      receive WM_CLOSE.
     *
     *      Here's how the PM frame handles WM_SYSCOMMAND
     *      with SC_CLOSE:
     *
     *      --  If the frame has a client, the frame posts
     *          WM_CLOSE to the client (_not_ to itself).
     *
     *      --  If the frame does not have a client,
     *          it posts WM_CLOSE to itself.
     *
     *      As a result, the frame never gets WM_CLOSE
     *      if there's a client, as in our case.
     *
     *      Note that the system switch list also sends
     *      WM_SYSCOMMAND with SC_CLOSE if the user
     *      tells it to stop a session.
     *
     *      The frame processes WM_CLOSE as follows:
     *
     *      --  If there's a client, it is forwarded
     *          (sent) to it.
     *
     *      --  If there's no client, WinDefWindowProc
     *          is called, which, according to PMREF,
     *          posts WM_QUIT.
     *
     *      As a result, we MUST intercept WM_CLOSE
     *      in the controller to avoid a WM_QUIT for
     *      the WPS process. However, we can't just post
     *      WM_CLOSE back to the frame (which would lead
     *      to infinite recursion), so this notification
     *      was introduced.
     *
     *      Again, this gets posted, not sent, so that
     *      the file dialog can intercept it in the
     *      main message loop.
     *
     *      mp2 is always NULL.
     *
     *      This message must always be processed by
     *      the subclassed frame, or the split view
     *      will never close.
     *
     *      The return code is ignored.
