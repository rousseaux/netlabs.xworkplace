     *      communication between the XWorkplace daemon
     *      and XFLDR.DLL (kernel.c).
     *
     *      This is allocated upon initial Desktop startup
     *      by initMain and then requested
     *      by the daemon. See xwpdaemn.c for details.

     *      Since the daemon keeps this block requested,
     *      it can be re-accessed by XFLDR.DLL upon
     *      Desktop restarts and be used for storing data
     *      in between WPS session restarts.
     *
     *      The data in this structure is not stored
     *      anywhere. This structure must only be modified
     *      when either the daemon or the WPS is started.
     *      For hook configuration, HOOKCONFIG is used
     *      instead, since the hook does NOT see this
     *      structure.
