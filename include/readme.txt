The INCLUDE directory tree contains include files for
most parts of XWorkplace.

Modify setup.h to adjust global compilation #define's. That
file is #include'd with all source files from src/helpers
and src/main.

Subdirectories:

INCLUDE\CLASSES has the include files generated by the SOM
    compiler from the .IDL files in the IDL directory.

INCLUDE\HELPERS has headers for the helpers code in SRC\HELPERS.

INCLUDE\MAIN has headers for the main DLL files (SRC\MAIN).

The main INCLUDE directory is included in the INCLUDE path by
the makefile. As a result, you have to specify the subdir with
#include, e.g. #include "startshut\apm.h".

See PROGREF.INF for details.
