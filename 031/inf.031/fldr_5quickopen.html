You can tell &xwp; to prepare certain folders to
display their contents more quickly when you open them. After the WPS
has booted, &xwp; will go through all folders which have this feature enabled
and read in their contents. If you then open one of these folders, its contents
will be displayed almost immediately.
<P>In order to enable this feature, open the Settings notebook for the folder
for which you wish to enable this feature. On the "XFolder" page therein,
check the "QuickOpen" flag.
<P>After the next Desktop startup, &xwp; will then read in the contents of that
folder and load all the icons. Note that &xwp; only does this right after the
WPS has booted, so changing the "QuickOpen" flag of a folder has no immediate
effect.
<P>Depending on how many folders have the "QuickOpen" flag set, Desktop startup might
take quite a while. Reading all the icons does not become faster by using this
feature. The only difference is that the icons are read earlier.
