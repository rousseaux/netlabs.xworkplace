<P>Are you too annoyed too by the fact that double-clicking on a URL or HTML
file on your hard disk will always start a new instance of
NETSCAPE.EXE, although Netscape is already running? This is a waste of time,
memory, and system resources.
<P>The <B>Netscape DDE Interface</B> is the solution.
You can associate it with HTML and URL
files, so that when you double-click on them, either Netscape
will be started or, if it's already running, the HTML file or URL
will simply be passed to the running instance.
<!-- the following updated with V0.9.12 -->

<P>NetscapeDDE should work with all of Netscape 2.02, 4.04, and 4.61 for &os2;.
Since Mozilla presently does not have DDE support (as of 2001-06-03), it won't
work with any of the current Mozilla-based browsers though.
