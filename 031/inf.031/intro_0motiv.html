<!-- Changed with V0.9.0: replace XFolder with &xwp; (also title) -->
<!--    Also check the notes below. -->

<P>Welcome to &xwp;!

<!-- The following completely rewritten for V0.9.1 -->
<P>&xwp; is intended to become the universal Workplace Shell (WPS) enhancer.
It is supposed to add lots of useful features to many parts of your system, while
being totally configurable, so that all features you don't like can be turned off.

<P>&xwp; has evolved from the popular <B>XFolder</B> utility.
However, since XFolder started
to manipulate many more things in the WPS than just folders, I chose to rename
the whole thing. Also, the package has been greatly extended to justify the name change.

<P>While XFolder was OpenSource already, it was still mainly developed by one person
(Ulrich M”ller, that is, myself).
By contrast, &xwp; is a truly open project on the Netlabs CVS server, so that
more programmers can easily join and contribute.
<!-- V0.9.4: added this -->
See <A HREF="notices_40source.html">"&xwp; source code"</A> for details.

<P>At this point, &xwp; already contains the features of XFolder,
<!-- V0.9.7: removed this: Animated Mouse Pointers for &os2;, -->
<!-- V0.9.3: added &pgr; -->
WarpEnhancer, and &pgr;,
and adds adds even more completely new features which were not
present in these packages yet.

<!-- V0.9.1: the following is unchanged -->
<P>In my view, the WPS ist still the one feature which makes &os2; stand out compared to other
operating systems. While other operating systems (especially Linux) have by now reached a
stability which is at least comparable, if not greater than &os2;'s, there is nothing that
I know of which can compare to the WPS in terms of productivity, flexibility and superior
overall concept.
<!-- the next one's new with V0.9.0 -->
<P>However, there are a number of things in the WPS which are truly annoying and
which IBM hasn't cared to fix so far, and probably never will.
<!-- many paragraphs have been removed here with V0.9.0 -->
<P>So &xwp; contains exactly those features I have missed working daily with &os2;;
I hope that you consider &xwp; just as useful as I do.
<!-- many paragraphs have been removed here with V0.9.1 -->
