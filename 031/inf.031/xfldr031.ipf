:h2 res=10022 x=right width=70%.Licence And Disclaimer
:p.
While older XFolder versions were "plain" freeware,
all XFolder versions since V0&per.80 and XWorkplace
too have been placed under the :hp2.GNU General Public Licence
(GPL):ehp2. Version 2&per. 
:p.
You can find the full text of the GPL in the plain-text
file :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.COPYING:font facename=default size=0x0. in the XWorkplace installation directory&per.
A formatted version of this document is available on
the :link reftype=hd res=10023.next page:elink. of this document&per. :hp2.
:p.
By installing XWorkplace on your system, you declare
your agreement to the terms and conditions of the GNU
General Public Licence, Version 2, as contained in the
file COPYING in the XWorkplace installation directory&per.:ehp2.

:p.
The GPL means more Legalese, but also :hp2.more rights:ehp2. for
you as a user and, if applicable, developer&per. The
most obvious change is that XWorkplace's source code
is also released&per. 
:p.
The following brief explanations are intended as an
introduction to the terms and conditions of the GPL
only&per. They are not part of the licence agreement,
for which only the terms and conditions in the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.COPYING:font facename=default size=0x0.
file shall prevail&per. 
:ul compact.:li.
If you are an :hp2.XWorkplace user,:ehp2. not much has changed&per.
You may still use XWorkplace without any payment to
anyone&per. The GPL does not restrict you on this matter,
because it only imposes restrictions on distribution
and modification of software&per. However, there is
still :hp2.no warranty:ehp2. whatsoever&per. If XWorkplace ruins
your system and your work of the last 30 years is lost,
sorry&per. (This is not very probable though)&per. Refer
to the bottom of the :link reftype=hd res=10023.GPL:elink. for the detailed disclaimer&per.

.br
:li.
If you're a :hp2.distributor,:ehp2. you may still distribute the
whole XWorkplace package&per. However, the GPL will
probably require you to also distribute the complete
XWorkplace source code&per. Refer to the :link reftype=hd res=10023.GPL:elink. for details&per.

.br
:li.
If you're a :hp2.developer,:ehp2. you now have the source code,
which you may use and modify&per. However, if you base
your own software on XWorkplace's source code, the GPL
will most probably :hp2.require you to place your work under
the GPL also&per.:ehp2. This means that you cannot use the
sources if you don't publish all your sources also&per.

:p.
Even though the source code is published, all developers
retain the copyright to what they've written&per. 
:p.
The GPL deals with these issues extensively&per. Before
you use or modify any code parts of XWorkplace, make
sure you read the GPL thoroughly&per. If your software
is GPL'd also, :hp2.by all means feel free to use the code&per.:ehp2.
If you have any questions, feel free to contact the
developer's team&per. 
:eul.
:p.
And now&colon. have fun with XWorkplace!

:hp2.GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
.br
Version 2, June 1991:ehp2. 
:p.
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc&per.

.br
675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA 
:p.
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim
copies of this license document, but changing it is
not allowed&per. :hp2.
:p.
Preamble:ehp2. 
:p.
The licenses for most software are designed to take
away your freedom to share and change it&per. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee
your freedom to share and change free software--to make
sure the software is free for all its users&per. This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose
authors commit to using it&per. (Some other Free Software
Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
Public License instead&per.) You can apply it to your
programs, too&per. 
:p.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to
freedom, not price&per. Our General Public Licenses
are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code
or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and
that you know you can do these things&per. 
:p.
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions
that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask
you to surrender the rights&per. These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify
it&per. 
:p.
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program,
whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients
all the rights that you have&per. You must make sure
that they, too, receive or can get the source code&per.
And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights&per. 
:p.
We protect your rights with two steps&colon. (1) copyright
the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives
you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify
the software&per. 
:p.
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want
to make certain that everyone understands that there
is no warranty for this free software&per. If the software
is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
recipients to know that what they have is not the original,
so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect
on the original authors' reputations&per. 
:p.
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by
software patents&per. We wish to avoid the danger that
redistributors of a free program will individually obtain
patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary&per.
To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent
must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed
at all&per. 
:p.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution
and modification follow&per. :hp2.
:p.
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
.br
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION:ehp2.
:hp2.
:p.
0&per.:ehp2. This License applies to any program or other
work which contains a notice placed by the copyright
holder saying it may be distributed under the terms
of this General Public License&per. The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based
on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative
work under copyright law&colon. that is to say, a work
containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim
or with modifications and/or translated into another
language&per. (Hereinafter, translation is included
without limitation in the term "modification"&per.)
Each licensee is addressed as "you"&per. 
:p.
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification
are not covered by this License; they are outside its
scope&per. The act of running the Program is not restricted,
and the output from the Program is covered only if its
contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent
of having been made by running the Program)&per. Whether
that is true depends on what the Program does&per. :hp2.
:p.
1&per.:ehp2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of
the Program's source code as you receive it, in any
medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices
that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program
a copy of this License along with the Program&per. 
:p.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring
a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection
in exchange for a fee&per. :hp2.
:p.
2&per.:ehp2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program
or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the
Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
that you also meet all of these conditions&colon. 
:ul compact.:li.
:hp2.a):ehp2. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent
notices stating that you changed the files and the date
of any change&per. 
.br
:li.
:hp2.b):ehp2. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,
that in whole or in part contains or is derived from
the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a
whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms
of this License&per. 
.br
:li.
:hp2.c):ehp2. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for
such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print
or display an announcement including an appropriate
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty
(or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that
users may redistribute the program under these conditions,
and telling the user how to view a copy of this License&per.
(Exception&colon. if the Program itself is interactive
but does not normally print such an announcement, your
work based on the Program is not required to print an
announcement&per.) 
:eul.
:p.
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole&per.
If identifiable sections of that work are not derived
from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent
and separate works in themselves, then this License,
and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
distribute them as separate works&per. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which
is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of
who wrote it&per. 
:p.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim
rights or contest your rights to work written entirely
by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right
to control the distribution of derivative or collective
works based on the Program&per. 
:p.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based
on the Program with the Program (or with a work based
on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution
medium does not bring the other work under the scope
of this License&per. :hp2.
:p.
3&per.:ehp2. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a
work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or
executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
above provided that you also do one of the following&colon.

:ul compact.:li.
:hp2.a):ehp2. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms
of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used
for software interchange; or, 
.br
:li.
:hp2.b):ehp2. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least
three years, to give any third party, for a charge no
more than your cost of physically performing source
distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
corresponding source code, to be distributed under the
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily
used for software interchange; or, 
.br
:li.
:hp2.c):ehp2. Accompany it with the information you received as
to the offer to distribute corresponding source code&per.
(This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial
distribution and only if you received the program in
object code or executable form with such an offer, in
accord with Subsection b above&per.) 
:eul.
:p.
The source code for a work means the preferred form
of the work for making modifications to it&per. For
an executable work, complete source code means all the
source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable&per.
However, as a special exception, the source code distributed
need not include anything that is normally distributed
(in either source or binary form) with the major components
(compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system
on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable&per. 
:p.
If distribution of executable or object code is made
by offering access to copy from a designated place,
then offering equivalent access to copy the source code
from the same place counts as distribution of the source
code, even though third parties are not compelled to
copy the source along with the object code&per. :hp2.
:p.
4&per.:ehp2. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute
the Program except as expressly provided under this
License&per. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License&per.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance&per.
:hp2.
:p.
5&per.:ehp2. You are not required to accept this License,
since you have not signed it&per. However, nothing else
grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
or its derivative works&per. These actions are prohibited
by law if you do not accept this License&per. Therefore,
by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance
of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions
for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or
works based on it&per. :hp2.
:p.
6&per.:ehp2. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any
work based on the Program), the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensor to copy,
distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms
and conditions&per. You may not impose any further restrictions
on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein&per.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
third parties to this License&per. :hp2.
:p.
7&per.:ehp2. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation
of patent infringement or for any other reason (not
limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on
you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)
that contradict the conditions of this License, they
do not excuse you from the conditions of this License&per.
If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute
the Program at all&per. For example, if a patent license
would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the
Program by all those who receive copies directly or
indirectly through you, then the only way you could
satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
entirely from distribution of the Program&per. 
:p.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
under any particular circumstance, the balance of the
section is intended to apply and the section as a whole
is intended to apply in other circumstances&per. 
:p.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you
to infringe any patents or other property right claims
or to contest validity of any such claims; this section
has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of
the free software distribution system, which is implemented
by public license practices&per. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
application of that system; it is up to the author/donor
to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software
through any other system and a licensee cannot impose
that choice&per. 
:p.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what
is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this
License&per. :hp2.
:p.
8&per.:ehp2. If the distribution and/or use of the Program
is restricted in certain countries either by patents
or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
holder who places the Program under this License may
add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted
only in or among countries not thus excluded&per. In
such case, this License incorporates the limitation
as if written in the body of this License&per. :hp2.
:p.
9&per.:ehp2. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised
and/or new versions of the General Public License from
time to time&per. Such new versions will be similar
in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns&per. 
:p.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number&per.
If the Program specifies a version number of this License
which applies to it and "any later version", you have
the option of following the terms and conditions either
of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation&per. If the Program does
not specify a version number of this License, you may
choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation&per. :hp2.
:p.
10&per.:ehp2. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program
into other free programs whose distribution conditions
are different, write to the author to ask for permission&per.
For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
sometimes make exceptions for this&per. Our decision
will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
status of all derivatives of our free software and of
promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally&per.
:hp2.
:p.
NO WARRANTY:ehp2. :hp2.
:p.
11&per.:ehp2. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE,
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW&per. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE&per. THE ENTIRE
RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU&per. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
OR CORRECTION&per. :hp2.
:p.
12&per.:ehp2. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW
OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR
ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR
DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO
OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES&per. :hp2.
:p.
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS:ehp2. :hp2.
:p.
Appendix&colon. How to Apply These Terms to Your New
Programs:ehp2. 
:p.
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be
of the greatest possible use to the public, the best
way to achieve this is to make it free software which
everyone can redistribute and change under these terms&per.

:p.
To do so, attach the following notices to the program&per.
It is safest to attach them to the start of each source
file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty;
and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
and a pointer to where the full notice is found&per.

:cgraphic.
<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does&per.>

:p.
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic

it output a short notice like this when it starts in
an interactive mode&colon.

:p.
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should
show the appropriate parts of the General Public License&per.
Of course, the commands you use may be called something
other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program&per.

:p.
You should also get your employer (if you work as a
programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright
disclaimer" for the program, if necessary&per. Here
is a sample; alter the names&colon.

:p.
Welcome to XWorkplace! 
:p.
XWorkplace is intended to become the universal Workplace
Shell (WPS) enhancer&per. It is supposed to add lots
of useful features to many parts of your system, while
being totally configurable, so that all features you
don't like can be turned off&per. 
:p.
XWorkplace has evolved from the popular :hp2.XFolder:ehp2. utility&per.
However, since XFolder started to manipulate many more
things in the WPS than just folders, I chose to rename
the whole thing&per. Also, the package has been greatly
extended to justify the name change&per. 
:p.
While XFolder was OpenSource already, it was still mainly
developed by one person (Ulrich Mîller, that is, myself)&per.
By contrast, XWorkplace is a truly open project on the
Netlabs CVS server, so that more programmers can easily
join and contribute&per. See :link reftype=hd res=10026."XWorkplace source code":elink.
for details&per. 
:p.
At this point, XWorkplace already contains the features
of XFolder, WarpEnhancer, and XPager, and adds adds
even more completely new features which were not present
in these packages yet&per. 
:p.
In my view, the WPS ist still the one feature which
makes OS/2 stand out compared to other operating systems&per.
While other operating systems (especially Linux) have
by now reached a stability which is at least comparable,
if not greater than OS/2's, there is nothing that I
know of which can compare to the WPS in terms of productivity,
flexibility and superior overall concept&per. 
:p.
However, there are a number of things in the WPS which
are truly annoying and which IBM hasn't cared to fix
so far, and probably never will&per. 
:p.
So XWorkplace contains exactly those features I have
missed working daily with OS/2; I hope that you consider
XWorkplace just as useful as I do&per. 
.br

.* Source file: "intro_1overview.html"
:h2 res=10031 x=right width=70%.Overview
:p.
XWorkplace has several "subcomponents", if you want&per.
Most of the new features are hooked into the WPS by
replacing a number of WPS classes&per. 
:p.
:hp2.Note&colon.:ehp2. Most XWorkplace features are disabled per
default to prevent problems already after XWorkplace
has been installed, because these might cause problems
on some systems&per. In order to get these to work,
open the new :hp2."XWorkplace Setup" object:ehp2. and go to the
"Features" page, where you will find everything&per.
See :link reftype=hd res=10011.XWorkplace Settings Objects:elink. for details&per. 
:ol compact.:li.
The Workplace Shell folder class (WPFolder) is replaced
with a new class, :hp2.XFolder,:ehp2. to introduce a lot of new
folder functionality&per. 
:p.
This includes :link reftype=hd res=10042.freely configurable context menus,:elink. quick
display of :link reftype=hd res=10044.folder contents:elink. in context menus, display
of the :link reftype=hd res=10048.full folder path:elink. in a folder's window title,
the prettiest and most flexible :link reftype=hd res=10056.folder status bars:elink. on
the planet, extended :link reftype=hd res=10050.folder sort functions,:elink. :link reftype=hd res=10051.auto-scrolling
of Tree views:elink., :link reftype=hd res=10053.folder hotkeys:elink. for frequently used folder/file
operations, and more&per. 
.br
:li.
XWorkplace allows you to :link reftype=hd res=10014.replace the system icons:elink. for
the most common object classes&per. 
.br
:li.
XWorkplace enhances the WPS's :link reftype=hd res=10007.file operations:elink. by adding
:link reftype=hd res=10060.extended file associations:elink. and adding a trash can for
"delete" operations&per. 
.br

:h2 res=10033 x=right width=70%.Request For Help
:p.
If you like XWorkplace and would like to contribute
to it, your support will be very welcome&per. XWorkplace
is slowly beginning to become too complex to be handled
by one person all alone&per. 
:ul compact.:li.
:hp2.Translations&per.:ehp2. XWorkplace is designed to be translateable
in a fairly easy way&per. All language-dependent parts
have been separated from the actual "intelligence" of
the program into separate files, which can be translated
independently&per. 
:p.
If you're interested in :hp2.translating XWorkplace to your
language,:ehp2. you can simply download the XWorkplace sources
from my homepage, which contain everything necessary
for this&per. You don't have to be a programmer to do
this, but it would be of great help if you have a basic
knowledge of HTML, since both XWorkplace's Online Reference
and the help file were originally written in HTML and
then simply converted to the IBM format, which I dislike
very much&per. 
:p.
In this case, please contact me, so I can add you to
my mailing list to allow you to get news about changes
in time&per. 
.br
:li.
If you're a programmer and have some experience in :hp2.PM
and/or WPS programming,:ehp2. please contact me also&per.
We have great plans for XWorkplace's future to overcome
the most obvious WPS limitations which exist today&per.
Since there's little hope that IBM will do anything
about this, I believe the OS/2 community needs to do
it themselves&per. The following major things are on
the to-do list&colon. 
.br

:ol compact.:li.
:hp2.WPS file handling&per.:ehp2. This needs some serious reworking&per.
I cannot believe that the WPS hangs every other time
one copies more than a dozen files&per. File handling
is the main task of an operating system's shell, and
the current implementation needs at least the following
enhancements&colon. thread-safety, speed, proper progress
bars when copying, a "Cancel" button that's not always
disabled, more meaningful error messages etc&per.pp&per.
This will require all of the WPS file-handling methods
to be reworked (:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.wpCopy:font facename=default size=0x0., :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.wpMove:font facename=default size=0x0. etc&per.)&per. 
.br
:li.
:hp2.Icon handling&per.:ehp2. Drag'n'drop in the WPS always causes
icons to be arranged in a fairly random way&per. This
should be improved&per. 
.br
:li.
:hp2.WPProgram&per.:ehp2. I have never understood why there's an
object for global DOS/Win-OS/2 settings if the program
objects don't respect the settings there&per. We need
support for global settings and also global and individual
environment variables in program objects so that :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.CONFIG&per.SYS:font facename=default size=0x0.
does not always have to be modified&per. 
.br
:li.
:hp2.WarpCenter&per.:ehp2. That thing is instable, slow, and does
not conform very well with the rest of the WPS&per.
This should be completely reprogrammed&per. Since XWorkplace
already has code for those "folder content" menus, this
shouldn't be too hard to to&per. 
.br
:li.
:hp2.Multi-user support&per.:ehp2. The WPS is already designed
to support multiple users thru the use of multiple OS2&per.INI
files and Desktop hierarchies, so I cannot quite understand
why IBM is not implementing this&per. XWorkplace could
do this; I am thinking of replacing the PROTSHELL and/or
RUNWORKPLACE statements in :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.CONFIG&per.SYS:font facename=default size=0x0. with some
XWorkplace executable, which will then start PMSHELL&per.EXE
with a bunch of preset environment variables, most importantly
OS2&per.INI settings and a UNIX-like HOME environment
variable to support multiple configurations for applications
in a "home" directory for each user&per. XWorkplace
should then offer a context menu item to "logoff" or
something&per. 
.br
:li.
OS/2 also needs to be able to :hp2.restart Presentation Manager:ehp2.
somehow without having to reboot, for example to change
display resolutions&per. The current solution is a joke&per.
If you have any ideas about this, especially how to
terminate and restart PM without blocking the system,
please contact me&per. 
:eol.

So if you're interested in adding any of these features
to XWorkplace (or if you have other suggestions), you'd
be very welcome to join the project! Any help is appreciated&per.

:eul.:hp2.
:p.
General note&per.:ehp2. As XWorkplace is providing more features
with every released version, chances increase that features
conflict with other parties' WPS replacement classes&per.
Depending on which software was installed first (and
thus appears first in the WPS class replacement list),
XWorkplace or the other product may not get a chance
to actually change the WPS's behavior&per. 
:p.
Moreover, since XWorkplace offers a number of features
which are also contained in other WPS packages (mostly
PM hooks), you should make sure that these features
are not enabled in several packages at the same time&per.
For example, you should not enable folder status bars
in both XWorkplace and Object Desktop, which can only
lead to problems, or activate the XWorkplace trash can
while another trash can software is also installed&per.
:hp2.
:p.
Warnings&per.:ehp2. The following list of incompatibilities
is based on reports by users of XWorkplace&per. I have
not verified these yet and include them only to save
you from trouble&per. 
:ul compact.:li.
:hp2.Object Desktop&per.:ehp2. OD manipulates the WPS just as intensively
as XWorkplace does (maybe even more), so it's just natural
that most problems have arised with this software&per.
:hp2.
:p.
Note&colon.:ehp2. I do not have Object Desktop&per. The following
is all I know&per. If you find out something, you're
welcome to tell me, and I'll add that to this section&per.
But please do not write me that OD does not cooperate
well with XWorkplace&per. :hp1.I know,:ehp1. and there's little
I can do about it&per. 
:p.
For all versions, the following rule applies&colon.
If you have trouble, XWorkplace probably conflicts with
OD's folder replacement class, TSEnhFolder&per. If nothing
else works, you can always deregister that class (using
the XWorkplace "WPS Class list" object), and you'll
probably get XWorkplace to work&per. 
:p.
But before that, mind the following notes&colon. :hp2.
:p.
All Object Desktop versions&per.:ehp2. 
:p.
I was reported that XWorkplace does not cooperate with
the :hp2."Browse mode":ehp2. feature of Object Desktop&per. You
will have to switch this feature off, sorry&per. 
:p.
Also, you should make sure to have the :hp2."Folder status
bars":ehp2. disabled in Object Desktop before enabling the
respective XWorkplace function, or the funniest things
might happen&per. 
:p.
Finally, I was reported that XFolder keeps adding status
bars to Object Desktop's :hp2."Launchpads":ehp2. even where they
don't belong&per. Apparently, these things are derived
from the WPFolder class also; they have an "XFolder"
page in their settings notebooks though, so you can
turn off XFolder's status bars for them&per. If the
object doesn't have an "XFolder" page, you can try to
manually use the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.STATUSBAR=NO:font facename=default size=0x0. folder setup string of
the XFolder class&per. :hp2.
:p.
Object Desktop 2&per.0&per.:ehp2. :link reftype=hd res=10170.Stefan Zechmeister:elink. got OD
2&per.0 to work with XWorkplace doing this&colon. 
:ol compact.:li.
Install OD 2&per.0&per. :li.
Install OD fixkit #1&per. :li.
Install XWorkplace&per. :li.
Go to the "XWorkplace Setup" object, "Paranoia" page,
and raise the "Menu item ID offset" to 700 or above&per.
Starting with V0&per.9&per.0, the default is now 700&per.

:eol.
:p.
If you then move XWorkplace's installation folder to
another folder, make sure the target folder has OD's
extra features turned off&per. Otherwise XWorkplace
will complain that its Configuration Folder does not
exist&per. 
.br
:li.
If you are using :hp2.NPS WPS,:ehp2. you must make sure to have
its "Select by name" and "Sort by extension" features
disabled, because XWorkplace offers these features also
and gets confused if these features are added by NPS
WPS also&per. 
:p.
XWorkplace does :hp1.not:ehp1. work with the automatic menu selection
of NPS WPS, at least not if you are using the "Folder
content" functions&per. This might lead to bad PM hangs&per.
Use XWorkplace's "Sliding menu" feature instead&per.

.br
:li.
I was reported that XWorkplace seems to have problems
cooperating with :hp2.Program Commander/2&per.:ehp2. Apparently,
this can be solved by switching off the "SmartIcons"
feature for title bars&per. 
.br
:li.
XWorkplace also seemed to have problems with :hp2.DragText:ehp2.
on some systems&per. There must be a setting somewhere
in that software to start DragText delayed, which should
solve this&per. 
.br
:li.
I was told by Hauke Laging that :hp2.Extended Clipboard (EClip):ehp2.
by Hinnerk Becker does not cooperate with XWorkplace&per.
On Hauke's Warp 4 system, the WPS hung at startup and
did not respond to anything&per. Hauke then told me
that the problem can be resolved by removing EClip from
the startup folder&per. (I was unable to reproduce all
this, but I'm reporting this to you anyway&per.) 
.br
:li.
Several users also reported that the "Snap to grid"
function did not seem to work&per. I have tested both
Warp 3 and 4 and encountered no problems; these users
all had some version of Object Desktop installed, so
I suspect in respect to the "Snap to grid" feature,
XWorkplace and Object Desktop seem to be colliding somehow&per.

.br
:li.
Bernd Schemmer reported that XWorkplace seems to be
using the same menu ID's as the :hp2.LAN Server GUI:ehp2.&per.
If you're using LAN Server (or other software that might
suffer from this), you can now change XWorkplace's menu
IDs in the :link reftype=hd res=10083."XWorkplace Setup":elink. object&per. The default
menu ID offset has now (V0&per.51) been raised from
100 to 300 to avoid these conflicts&per. 
.br
:li.
Michael Holzapfel reported that installing GRADD drivers
for the :hp2.ELSA Winner 2000FC:ehp2. video card crashed his system
when XWorkplace V0&per.71 was installed, causing a CHKDSK
at the next reboot, which in turn damaged the newly
installed drivers, so the system wouldn't start at all&per.
He told me that de-installing XWorkplace helped&per.

don't like each other too much&per. On his system, he

When a folder is first opened in the WPS, it is "populated"

As you will know, the WPS is not good at handling large

:p.
Detailed description:ehp2. 
:p.
Essentially, the "turbo folders" feature is a full rewrite
of the folder populate code&per. XWorkplace uses the
following techniques to make this a lot faster&colon.

:ul compact.:li.
Each folder now has a binary balanced tree containing
all the objects that have been added to the folder's
internal content list so far&per. For file-system objects,
this tree is sorted by the objects' short real names&per.
This makes it much more efficient to find out if the
object is already in the tree or still needs to be added&per.
I assume that the original checkup code in the WPS is
responsible for the enourmous delays with large amounts
of files&per. 
.br
:li.
Instead of only one extra thread, "turbo folders" will
start two extra threads for populating a folder&per.
One is reponsible for collecting file data from the
disk (via the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.DosFindFirst:font facename=default size=0x0. and :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.DosFindNext:font facename=default size=0x0. system APIs),
and the other one is responsible for checking whether
the object is already awake and creating a new object,
if necessary&per. 
:p.
Depending on the file system, the above two APIs can
be quite slow when extended attributes have to be collected
(as is the case with the WPS)&per. While this happens,
the calling thread is blocked, doing nothing but waiting
for data from the hard disk to arrive&per. This idle
time can now be used by the other thread for creating
the object in memory, which can be quite time consuming
as well&per. 
:p.
In addition, using two threads will scale better on
multi-processor (SMP) systems&per. 
:p.
The above two techniques together made folder populating
so much faster&per. The time that is now needed for
populating the folder roughly equates the time that
the system spends in the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.DosFindFirst:font facename=default size=0x0. and :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.DosFindNext:font facename=default size=0x0.
system APIs, so I do not think this can be sped up much
more (unless somebody manages to make these system APIs
more efficient)&per. 
.br
:li.
"Turbo folders" also completely replaces the icon loading
for executable files&per. As you will know, if you open
a folder with &per.EXE files, the WPS will attempt to
find an icon in the executable and, if one is found,
use it for the object&per. Program and data file objects
will also load icons from executables&per. 
:p.
The WPS code for loading icons suffers from several
limitations&per. Most importantly, it appears to be
slow&per. This code has also been totally replaced in
XWorkplace&per. 
:p.
In addition, the WPS does not appear to share icons
much in the WPS&per. XWorkplace will also attempt to
reuse icons as much as possible to avoid the need to
reload them from the executables all the time&per. 
:p.
Essentially I am no longer allowing the WPS to read
executable icons at all, but will only use my own code
for now&per. This works for LX and Win16 and OS/2 NE
executables&per. Win32 PE resources (as used by most
executables under Windows 95 or newer) are presently
not understood; PE files will receive a dull default
icon, but at least the WPS will no longer hang forever
with them&per. 
:p.
As one side effect, this will change the behavior for
Win16 icons if the system icon size is 40x40; instead
of scaling, XWorkplace will now center the 32x32 icon&per.

Normally, if you click on the "plus" sign next to the
"dll" directory, the tree will expand, but you will
not be able to see its contents&per. This default OS/2
behavior is really tiresome, because almost every other
time that a Tree view is expanded, you'll have to scroll
down manually to actually see the contained objects&per.

window if the newly appearing items begin to appear
outside the currently visible window area&colon. 
.br

:artwork name='intro_4treeviews2.bmp' runin align=left.

XFolder does this by internally monitoring the Tree
view in the background after you click on the "plus"
sign and then, as soon as the WPS is done populating
the folder, automatically scrolls down&per. This "monitoring"
does not cause an additional CPU load, because XFolder
simply intercepts a single window notification message
internally&per. (For this reason it is totally inconceivable
that IBM has not implemented this behavior already&per.)

XFolder will make the bottom-most item that was displayed
visible, unless the tree below the folder you clicked
on contains too many items to fit into the window&per.

expanded to the very top of the visible window area&per.

yourself, in order to get used to it&per. The OS/2 directory

Unfortunately, this has proven to be the most difficult,
shaky, and obscure part of the WPS&per. The WPS is extremely
multithreaded, and IBM hasn't cared to document exactly
those interfaces which control the various file threads&per.

:p.
There are a few things which I have found anyway, even
though IBM didn't want me to, so here we go&per. :hp2.

As you probably know, per default the WPS associates
programs to data files using two mechanisms&colon. "associations
by file type" and "associations by file filter"&per.

:p.
If XWorkplace's extended file associations are enabled,
you will :hp1.only:ehp1. have associations by file type&per. :hp1.
:p.
However,:ehp1. since most files do not have an explicit file
type set (which can be done on the "Type" page in a
file's settings notebook), XWorkplace will automatically
assign file types to file objects according to file
filters&per. This way you get the best of both worlds
(file types and file filters) in a more logical way&per.

:p.
So what is this good for? 
:p.
For one, I have found the standard WPS association mechanism
slightly awkward if associations are added according
to both file filters and file types&per. The new approach
is more logical in this sense&per. 
:p.
Secondly, and most importantly, XWorkplace allows you
to define :hp2.file type hierarchies&per.:ehp2. For example, there
are many file types which are really "plain text" files
also (for example, "C Code" or "HTML" files), so any
editor which can read "plain text" should be able to
read those file types also&per. 
:p.
Until now, you had to associate the same editor to all
those file types&per. With XWorkplace, you can now define
any type to be a "sub-type" of "plain text", and that
sub-type will :hp2.inherit:ehp2. the associations defined for the
parent type&per. 
:p.
This can be done on the new "File types" page in the

old file filters into the new associations&per. To do

deleted something by opening the trash can (which behaves

This applies to the menu item in each object's context
menu as well as the "Delete" key when it's pressed in
a folder window&per. Both actions will then move the
selected objects into the trash can first instead of
really deleting them&per. 
:p.
You can still perform a "true" delete (that is, really
delete the object, instead of moving it into the trash
can) by holding down the "Shift" key while clicking

:eol.

or :hp2.restored:ehp2. (which will put the object back to the location
where it was deleted from)&per. 
:artwork name='trashcan.bmp' align=left.

Also, when any objects are in the trash can, the trash
can object itself has an additional menu item called

you get a proper progress bar which shows you the progress

the Workplace Shell's folder auto-refresh mechanism&per.

:p.
You are probably familiar with this feature of the Workplace
Shell&per. If you have a folder open and manipulate
files in that folder from the command line, you will
see that the WPS magically will know about these modifications
and refresh the folder automatically&per. 
:p.
While this is a great feature in theory, there are severe
limitations with the standard implementation of this
in the WPS&per. Most importantly, the WPS will create
excessive file-system handles for all objects that are
auto-refreshed, which will unnecessarily blow up your
INI files&per. Note that this even happens if you have
the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.AUTOREFRESHFOLDERS=NO:font facename=default size=0x0. setting in your :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.CONFIG&per.SYS:font facename=default size=0x0.
file&per. 
:p.
XWorkplace can now replace this entire mechanism if
you have enabled this replacement on the "Features"
page in the :link reftype=hd res=10083."XWorkplace Setup" object&per.:elink. 
:p.
If the replacement is enabled, XWorkplace will prevent
the internal WPS threads which are responsible for folder
auto-refresh from running&per. Among other things, this
will prevent file-system handles from being created&per.
Instead, XWorkplace will start its own threads which
will start monitoring file-system activity and automatically
refresh folders then&per. 
:p.
Note that as a result, enabling or disabling the replacement
requires a Desktop restart because XWorkplace can only
do this replacement while the WPS is starting up&per.

:p.
However, once the replacement has been enabled and the
WPS has been restarted, you can enable and disable folder
auto-refresh on the "View" page in the "Workplace Shell"
object without having to restart the WPS&per.

explained in detail on the following pages&per. :hp2.

Notes&colon.:ehp2. 
:ol compact.:li.
All these features are disabled per default and have
to be enabled individually on the "Features" page of
the :link reftype=hd res=10083."XWorkplace Setup":elink. object&per. In order to implement
these features, quite a number of changes had to be
made to some core functions of the Workplace Shell&per.
So if something is not working right, you can selectively
enable/disable each feature&per. 
.br

XWorkplace now has a :hp2."Startup panic" dialog:ehp2. which is
displayed if you hold down the :hp2."Shift" key:ehp2. while the
WPS is starting up&per. 
:p.
So if you enable some startup feature and your WPS hangs
at startup, press Ctrl+Alt+Del and hold down the "Shift"
key when the system switches to graphics mode until
the dialog appears&per.

This dialog allows you to temporarily disable certain
XWorkplace startup features and then continue booting&per.

:p.
Starting with V0&per.9&per.0, XWorkplace offers you
an enhanced interface to the WPS archiving feature which
had been introduced with OS/2 Warp 3&per. The new functionality
is similar to that of the WPSArcO package and has been
kindly provided by that software's author, Stefan Milcke&per.

:p.
The new functionality can be :hp2.configured:ehp2. on the "Archives"
page in the Desktop's settings notebook, which is replaced
by XWorkplace&per. 
:p.
Basically, instead of just letting you decide whether
the WPS should :hp1.always:ehp1. be archived at Desktop startup,
XWorkplace now offers you much more flexible criteria
for whether the WPS should be backed up&per. 
:p.
The archives format itself is not changed&per. You can
therefore still press Alt+F1 when OS/2 is starting to
restore your backups&per. The new features only deal
with :hp1.whether:ehp1. the WPS should be backed up&per. 
:p.
When the WPS is starting up and XWorkplace is thus loaded
too, it now checks the system configuration according
to the settings which you have specified&per. If it
turns out that the WPS needs to be archived according
to your settings, archiving is turned on, the WPS continues
booting, and the WPS will then back up your Desktop&per.

:p.
You can, for example, specify that the WPS should be
backed up every so-and-so days or based on a certain
percentage that the INI files have changed&per.

The archiving criteria are described in detail when
you press "Help" on the new "Archives" page in the Desktop's

XFolder 0&per.85 introduced the possibility to display
a user-defined bitmap during Desktop startup&per. With
XWorkplace 0&per.9&per.0, a new "Startup" page was introduced
to the Desktop's settings notebook to allow for easy

:p.
The boot logo will remain visible until the WPS has
completely initialized itself&per. It will then disappear
and no longer consume any system resources&per. 
:p.
The :hp2."Startup" page in the Desktop's settings notebook:ehp2.
allows you to define the boot logo bitmap and style&per.
More information can be obtained by pressing the "Help"
button on that page&per. 
:p.
I have included three boot logos with XWorkplace&colon.

:ul compact.:li.
:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.xfolder&per.bmp:font facename=default size=0x0. (which will be used per default) is
a variation of the old XFolder logo&per. This should
still be handled by weaker systems too&per. :li.
:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.os2warpx&per.bmp:font facename=default size=0x0. is an alternative, new design, which
I like much better, which however might take too long
to display on weaker systems&per. On my Pentium-133,
this one takes about two seconds to display&per. :li.
:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.penguin&per.bmp:font facename=default size=0x0. is new with V0&per.9&per.0&per. This
is the well-known Linux penguin with an OS/2 logo on
its belly&per. 
:eul.
:p.
When :hp2.using your own bitmaps,:ehp2. mind these important notes&colon.

:ol compact.:li.
The boot logo must be an :hp2.uncompressed OS/2 1&per.3 bitmap:ehp2.
file&per. V2&per.0 bitmaps won't be loaded&per. I had
to include my own bitmap loading code because at the
time of Desktop startup, the WPS's multimedia classes
don't work yet&per. You can use PMView or the WPS multimedia
classes to convert existing files to 1&per.3 format&per.

.br
:li.
Transparency is calculated according to the most lower-left
corner pixel of the bitmap&per. That is, all pixels
which have the same color as pixel (0, 0) will be made
transparent&per. 
.br
:li.
You should be very careful in replacing these bitmaps&per.
The transparency calculations are extremely CPU-intensive&per.
If you use a 500x500 pixel bitmap with half of the pixels
transparent, this can block your system for many minutes&per.
And I mean :hp1.block,:ehp1. because most of the calculating time
is consumed by Presentation Manager (PM), and this will
usually hang the whole system&per. 
:p.
If everything goes wrong and your WPS won't start any
more, you can :hp2.hold down the "Shift" key:ehp2. while the WPS
is starting up&per. This will display the :link reftype=hd res=10064."Startup panic"
dialog:elink., where you can disable the boot logo and take
care of the problem after the WPS is up&per. 
:p.
Since PM was designed to display rectangular windows
only, the way these "shape" windows are done is that
the bitmap is analyzed pixel by pixel and as many PM
subwindows are created as rectangular non-transparent
areas exist in the bitmap&per. 
:p.
For this reason, be very careful with transparency&per.
The more non-rectangular transparent areas are in the
bitmap, the more windows have to be created&per.

This would already create nine windows&colon. one for
the top line, then two each for the following lines,
and another one for each of the bottom lines&per. So
imagine such an image with 500 lines&colon. this would
create at least 500 subwindows&per. 
:p.
To make this clear&colon. it's not the parsing of the
bitmap which uses a lot of CPU time&per. It's the creation
of subwindows&per. So large bitmaps will not hurt if
there's very little or only rectangular transparency&per.

:p.
I found this out the hard way when I accidently dithered
a bitmap to the system color palette&per. Suddenly,
there were hundreds of transparent and non-transparent
areas alternating (because the background which I intended
was dithered)&per. 
:p.
The bitmap had about 100 lines, and I got several 1000
windows&per. I pressed Ctrl-Alt-Del after about two
minutes&per. 
:p.
So be warned&per. Start out with small bitmaps and see
what your system can handle&per. For large bitmaps,
try to make the transparent areas rectangular&per. Do
not dither bitmaps, but use plain colors instead&per.

Restarting the WPS can be helpful when your system has

Please keep in mind that this is not the way of restarting
the Workplace Shell that IBM intended when developing
it&per. "Restart Desktop" forces the WPS to restart
by simply terminating it&per. Since XWorkplace is part
of the WPS process, it can simply exit&per. OS/2 will
then restart this process automatically&per. The result

On my system, the icons of executables in folders get
scrambled after a Desktop restart&per. This applies
to all program objects and executable files which are

wrong icons are displayed&per. This is a bug in the

are re-read upon restarting the WPS&per. If these settings
have changed, a Desktop restart will not recognize these
changes&per. Reboot instead&per. 
.br
:li.
As a general rule, the more WPS classes you have installed,
the more problems are likely to arise when restarting
the WPS&per. This can be due to many reasons, which
I don't fully understand, but for one certain third-party
WPS classes do not seem to clean up allocated resources
properly when the WPS is terminated&per. Second, the
SOM kernel does seem to get confused sometimes with
WPS class replacements, and some parts of the WPS then
crash about 20 seconds after the Desktop has been populated&per.

:p.
In these cases, you will be reported fairly random crashes
in certain DLLs, which are just symptoms of something
going wrong internally&per. If this happens, you will
have to reboot&per. Candidates for these random DLL
crashes that I have unveiled are INSTALL&per.DLL (contains

Folder, you may not set a delay here, but XWorkplace
waits before starting the next object until the currently
opened object has been closed again&per. Only if all

:p.
Starting with V0&per.9&per.0, XWorkplace also introduces
a number of mouse and keyboard enhancements by installing
a Presentation Manager hook, similar to what well-known
enhancers such as FeelX, NPS WPS, and WarpEnhancer do&per.

:p.
So XWorkplace now also goes for features like "sliding
focus", "hot corners", and "object hotkeys"&per. These
are described in detail on the following pages&per.

:p.
The ultimate goal for this XWorkplace component is to
replace all those PM hook utilities one day&per. In
my view, several problems exist with those utilities&colon.

:ol compact.:li.
Most importantly, most of these have not been actively
maintained for years&per. This especially applies to
FeelX and NPS WPS, both of which I have been using for
years&per. However, both of them have a few limitations
which will never be overcome because they probably won't
ever be updated again&per. 
.br
:li.
Both utilities are not well integrated into the WPS&per.
That is, their settings cannot be changed using the
standard WPS notebooks&per. XWorkplace allows you to
configure its PM hook using the "Mouse" and "Keyboard"
objects in the "System Setup" folder&per. And NPS WPS
always terminates itself when the WPS is restarted,
which is pretty annoying&per. 
.br
:li.
None of the well-known PM hook utilities are OpenSource,
except ProgramCommander/2 (which is even public domain)&per.
XWorkplace is OpenSource, so bugs can be reported and/or
fixed by users&per. 
.br
:li.
Finally, I just hate to install three different PM hooks
when I only need a single feature from each of these&per.
Each installed PM hook slows down the system, because
every single message which is produced by OS/2 and posted
or sent to a window must go thru all of these hooks,
each of which does a lot of calculations for that message&per.
And we're talking about possibly hundreds of messages
per second here&per. So instead of having three hooks
installed which are only partly used, XWorkplace attempts
to put the most frequently-used features all together
in one hook&per. 
:eol.
:p.
Note that the XWorkplace PM hook is a completely optional
feature&per. If you don't like it and prefer to still
use other utilites, feel free to do so&per. 
:p.
For this reason, the XWorkplace hook is disabled per
default&per. It must be enabled first in the "XWorkplace
Setup" object&per.

:h2 res=10072 x=right width=70%.Sliding Focus
:p.
:hp2.Classes&colon. XWPSetup, XWPMouse:ehp2. :cgraphic.________________________________________________________________________________:ecgraphic.
:p.
XWorkplace's "sliding focus" feature is very similar
to that offered by many other PM hooks&per. 
:p.
Basically, this feature means that the keyboard input
focus always follows the mouse pointer&per. That is,
if you move the mouse, the window under the mouse pointer
will be given the input focus (which means that also
the title bar will be made active)&per. 
:p.
This behavior is very common with the various window
managers running on the X-Window windowing system used
with the many flavors of UNIX, and Linux has inherited
this also&per. Since many people prefer to have this
behavior with OS/2 too (including myself), this has
been included with XWorkplace&per. 
:p.
This feature can be :hp2.configured:ehp2. in the "Mouse" object,
which usually resides in your "System Setup" folder&per.
On the "Movement" page in that object, there are several
settings&per. Press the "Help" button on that page to
find out more&per. :hp2.
:p.
Note&colon.:ehp2. That page is only visible if the XWPMouse
class is installed and the XWorkplace hook has been
enabled in :link reftype=hd res=10082."XWorkplace Setup"&per.:elink. 
:p.
The main advantage of this feature is that for one,
you don't have to click into a window to be able to
use the keyboard with it&per. Also, if you have disabled
the "Bring window to top" setting on the "Mouse hook"
page, you can even type into a window which is not the
topmost window, which is impossible without the "Sliding
focus" feature&per. This takes a bit of getting used
to, but this can be very handy when several windows
are opened and you need to view one window's information
while typing into another&per. :hp2.
:p.
Notes:ehp2. 
:ol compact.:li.
There's no way to make this feature work properly with
:hp2.seamless Win-OS/2 windows&per.:ehp2. The 16-bit Windows graphics
engine (Graphical Device Interface, GDI) is not capable
of differentiating between a "topmost" and an "active"
window; it simply assumes that the topmost window must
always be the active one&per. This limitation applies
to seamless Win-OS/2 windows also, which use the 16-bit
Windows graphics engine internally&per. 
:p.
For this reason, there is a special setting on the "Movement"
page in the "Mouse" settings notebook for Win-OS/2 windows&per.
You can either decide to always bring Win-OS/2 windows
to the top, or to ignore them completely&per. It is
however not possible to make them active without bringing
them to the top&per. Otherwise you'd get really strange
repainting errors on your screen, because the GDI would
repaint an active Win-OS/2 window completely even if
other windows are on top of it (because it assumes it
must be the topmost window)&per. 
:p.
Of course, full-screen Win-OS/2 sessions are not affected
by XWorkplace in any way, because the XWorkplace PM
hook does not deal with Win-OS/2 fullscreen sessions&per.

.br
:li.
While the :hp2.PM window list:ehp2. (or tasklist) is showing on
the screen, the sliding focus feature is temporarily
disabled&per. This is necessary because the window list
automatically disappears when it loses the keyboard
focus&per. If the sliding focus weren't disabled while
the window list is showing, it would become difficult
to do anything with the window list at all, because
it would kept disappearing if the mouse pointer was
not over it&per.

"sliding menus" feature affects open menus&per. This
applies to pull-down menus as well as popup (context)
menus&per.

This feature can be enabled on the "Movement" page in
the "Mouse" settings object as well, if the XWPMouse

If this is enabled, the menu selection in an open menu
will follow the mouse pointer&per. 
:p.
This feature can be configured in several ways&per.
You can choose to have a behavior as with NPSWPS, that
is, the menu behaves as if you held down mouse button
1 all the time&per. 
:p.
However, you can also choose to make menus behave as
with Windows 95, if you prefer&per. To do this, on the
"Movement" page in the "Mouse" settings object, raise
the "Submenu delay" and enable the "Immediate hilite"

:p.
:hp2.Classes&colon. XWPSetup, XWPMouse:ehp2. :cgraphic.________________________________________________________________________________:ecgraphic.
:p.
If you have a three-button mouse, XWorkplace's PM hook
also allows you to reconfigure mouse button 3 (the middle
mouse button on most mice) to do useful things, since
that button is normally useless with OS/2 and most OS/2
applications&per. 
:p.
There are two mouse button 3 features at this point&colon.

:ul compact.:li.
XWorkplace allows to have all single mouse button 3
clicks converted to :hp2.mouse button 1 double clicks&per.:ehp2.
This allows you, for example, to click on a Desktop
object with mouse button 3 once, and the object will
be opened as if you had double-clicked on it&per. 
.br
:li.
XWorkplace also allows you to :hp2.scroll windows contents:ehp2.
by dragging the mouse while mouse button 3 is held down&per.
If the window under the mouse has scroll bars, the window
will be scrolled as if you had used the scroll bars
even if the mouse is somewhere else over the window's
contents&per. This saves you a lot of mouse mileage&per.

:eul.
:p.
Both features can be enabled in the "Mouse" object on
the new second "Mappings" page, which is added by XWorkplace&per.
There are a lot of configuration options to adjust these
features to your needs&per. Press the "Help" button
on that page for details&per. :hp2.
:p.
Note&colon.:ehp2. That page is only visible if the XWPMouse

:p.
:hp2.Classes&colon. XFldObject, XWPSetup, XWPKeyboard:ehp2. :cgraphic.________________________________________________________________________________:ecgraphic.
:p.
Starting with V0&per.9&per.0, XWorkplace also introduces
"object hotkeys", which means that you can open any
object in its default view by pressing a certain hotkey
combination, which you can define individually for each
object&per. 
:p.
As with all XWorkplace hook features, object hotkeys
are disabled per default&per. You need to enable them
in the "XWorkplace setup" object first&per. :hp2.
:p.
Note&colon.:ehp2. Do not confuse object hotkeys with :link reftype=hd res=10053.folder
hotkeys,:elink. as displayed in the "Workplace Shell" settings
object&per. Object hotkeys are used to open objects
using a key definition and work everywhere, while folder
hotkeys are shortcuts to certain folder commands and
work in folders only&per. 
:p.
Object hotkeys can be :hp2.configured:ehp2. in two places&per.
For one, XWorkplace inserts a new "Object" page into
each single :hp2.object's settings notebook&per.:ehp2. This applies
to really all objects (that is, folders, files, printers,
program objects, etc&per.)&per. By clicking into the
"Hotkey" entry field, you may define a key combination
for that object&per. From then on, if you press this
key combination anywhere on your system, the object
will be opened in its default view (as if you had double-clicked
on it)&per. 
:p.
Secondly, XWorkplace inserts a new page into the :hp2."Keyboard"
settings object,:ehp2. which per default resides in your "System
Setup" folder&per. On this new page, which is called
"Hotkeys" for some reason, all currently defined object
hotkeys are listed&per. 
:p.
There are some :hp2.limitations:ehp2. with respect to object hotkeys&per.
Since hotkey detection is done in the XWorkplace PM
hook, object hotkeys only work in the Presentation Manager
(PM) screen session&per. This includes all PM applications,
the WPS itself, plus windowed (seamless) OS/2, DOS and
Win-OS/2 sessions, but :hp1.not:ehp1. DOS, OS/2 or Win-OS/2 :hp1.fullscreen:ehp1.

:h2 res=10076 x=right width=70%.Registering Extra Function Keys
:p.
:hp2.Classes&colon. XWPKeyboard:ehp2. :cgraphic.________________________________________________________________________________:ecgraphic.
:p.
Starting with V0&per.9&per.3, XWorkplace allows you
to give certain keys which normally don't work under
OS/2 a special meaning&per. You can then use those extra
keys as object hotkeys as well&per. In order for this
to work, you will need to register those keys with the
"Function keys" page in the enhanced "Keyboard" object&per.

:p.
This feature is implemented through the XWorkplace PM
hook as well&per. To understand how this is working
(and before you use the "Function keys" page), the following
explanations should be understood&per. 
:p.
Keyboard processing is a complex issue under any operating
system&per. It involves interpreting hardware messages
and translating those according to the current language
settings&per. 
:p.
Under OS/2, this processing is done on several layers
of the system&per. For one, there is the hardware keyboard
device driver which gets loaded though a BASEDEV statement
in :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.CONFIG&per.SYS:font facename=default size=0x0.&per. This one reacts to hardware interrupts
raised by the physical keyboard hardware and thus receives
really every single keystroke on the system&per. 
:p.
The OS/2 Kernel then processes those keystrokes for
the application which currently has the input focus&per.
Further processing is different depending on the type
of application&per. Presentation Manager (PM) applications
(including the Workplace Shell) usually receive a message
that a key has been pressed or released&per. The XWorkplace
PM hook can thus intercept these messages and manipulate
them&per. (This is how :link reftype=hd res=10075.object hotkeys:elink. work as well,
by the way&per.) 
:p.
Unfortunately, the default OS/2 keyboard processing
is still based on the original 101/102-key IBM-compatible
AT keyboards introduced in the 1980's&per. Today, many
keyboards have additional keys which are not recognized
at all by OS/2 or simply produce a character output
even though they aren't really supposed to&per. 
:p.
Those extra function keys could be the three "Windows"
keys found on most keyboards sold today&per. In addition,
there are some extended keyboards which have additional
"multimedia" keys&per. Also, many laptops have some
extra keys&per. 
:p.
The XWorkplace PM hook can identify the physical key
which has actually been pressed by evaluating the :hp2.hardware
scan code:ehp2. of the key, which is passed to any PM application
directly from the keyboard hardware&per. On every keyboard,
every key should have a unique such code&per. This code
has nothing to do with the ASCII code of a character,
it's just a unique number assigned to each physical
key on the keyboard&per. For example, the "Shift" key
will have such a code as well as the "A" key, even though
the "Shift" key alone will produce no ASCII (character)
output&per. 
:p.
So the XWorkplace hook needs to know the hardware scan
code of your function keys in order to be able to react
to them&per. As a result, you will need to :hp2.register:ehp2.
your extra keys with XWorkplace&per. Those keys are
then called :hp2."XWorkplace function keys":ehp2. and will be recognized
by XWorkplace&per. You can, for example, use them as
:link reftype=hd res=10075.object hotkeys:elink. after having registered them&per. 
:p.
To :hp2.register such a function key with XWorkplace,:ehp2. go
to the enhanced "Keyboard" object and switch to the
new "Function keys" page&per. Right-click on the container
whitespace and select "Add function key"&per. You'll
get additional help by pressing the "Help" buttons there&per.
:hp2.
:p.
Warnings&per.:ehp2. 
:ol compact.:li.
There is virtually :hp2.no error checking:ehp2. when registering
a function key with XWorkplace&per. Scan codes are hardware-dependent,
so there's no way for XWorkplace to tell whether a certain
scan code really shouldn't be registered&per. For example,
you could also register the "Enter" or any character
key as a function key, which really isn't a good idea&per.
:hp2.So register only "real" extra keys with XWorkplace,
or the key might no longer work&per.:ehp2. 
.br
:li.
Some keys will refuse to be registered&per. If this
happens, this means that the keyboard hardware doesn't
produce a scan code for the key&per. I have a Fujitsu
multimedia keyboard with some 15 extra keys, and three
of them just don't work&per. I guess we'd need a device
driver to interpret those extra three keys, but this
is beyond my knowledge&per. 
.br
:li.
As usual, the function keys will only be detected while
a PM window has the focus&per. They will not work in
full-screen DOS or full-screen Win-OS/2 sessions&per.

XPager was originally PageMage, a freeware program written
by Carlos Ugarte&per. From what I know, the last public
version was 0&per.36&per. Since the author no longer
had the time to work on it, he published the sources
under the GPL&per. 
:p.
While earlier XWorkplace versions were still based on
the original PageMage sources, this is no longer the
case&per. XPager is a complete rewrite, even though
it may look quite similar and borrowed some good ideas
from PageMage&per. 
:p.
XPager is initially disabled&per. To turn it on, go
to the "Features" page in the :link reftype=hd res=10083."XWorkplace Setup" object:elink.
and check the respective box&per. This requires that
the :hp2.XWorkplace PM hook:ehp2. also be installed&per. 
:p.
XPager is a :hp2.virtual desktop utility for OS/2&per.:ehp2. Essentially,
it allows the user to work on several desktops at once&per.
Your screen is considered one out of several, and you
can switch between these&per. This effectively multiplies
your working area since windows can reside outside your
currently visible desktop and still be switched to simply
by switching to another desktop&per. 
:artwork name='pagemage.bmp' align=left.
:p.
Traditionally, most virtual desktop programs show a
representation of the overall desktop in a window, highlighting
the current desktop&per. The standard mechanism for
switching desktops has been to click (with a mouse)
on one of the other desktops, which would remove the
current desktop's windows and display the new desktop's
windows&per.

XPager can be :hp2.configured:ehp2. in the new :link reftype=hd res=10082."Screen" settings

You can use :hp2.special global hotkeys:ehp2. for switching between

You can change the modifiers in the new :link reftype=hd res=10082."Screen" settings

Those hotkeys work even if you have XWorkplace's :link reftype=hd res=10075.global

A :hp2.sticky window:ehp2. is a window that is always visible on
all desktops&per. While this may seem to be "wasting
space", sticky windows can be very useful&per. 
:p.
There are some applications which are small in screen
space consumption, such as clocks, resource monitors,
program launchers, which you might prefer to see on
all desktops&per. You can therefore declare them as
sticky on the XPager settings pages in the :link reftype=hd res=10082."Screen"

switch list title&per. For details, refer to the help

.* Source file: "pgmg_8howwork.html"
:h2 res=10080 x=right width=70%.How It Works
:p.
:hp2.Classes&colon. XWPScreen:ehp2. :cgraphic.________________________________________________________________________________:ecgraphic.
:p.
XPager needs :hp2.no special hardware:ehp2. to implement these
virtual desktops&per. While the various implementations
of the Unix X Window system (one of which is XFree/2,
which runs under OS/2) can actually use additional memory
on your video card to have room for several desktops,
XPager simply moves windows around your screen&per.

:p.
To make this clear&colon. With XPager, technically,
you still only have one screen&per. Neither PM nor your
video driver know anything about virtual desktops&per.
All XPager does when switching desktops is to move windows
off of and onto your one visible screen&per. That is,
if you switch one desktop to the right, XPager moves
all windows to the left by the size of your physical
screen (which makes them invisible, of course)&per.
As a result, no special hardware or software or drivers
are required&per. If your computer can handle moving
windows, it can use XPager&per. 
:p.
The small XPager pager window then does a number of
calculations to make all windows look as if they were
part of a huge virtual screen, but your physical screen
really doesn't change -- it's the windows that are moved&per.

:p.
XPager also needs the XWorkplace PM hook to be able
to track window movement -- for one, to reflect window
changes in the XPager window, secondly to be informed
when windows are created or destroyed for any reason&per.
It can then, for example, automatically switch desktops
(that is, move all windows) if the focus is given to
a window of another desktop&per.

which means that you can configure the XWorkplace PM
hook to automatically open a certain object in its default
view if the mouse pointer is moved to one of the four
corners or one of the four borders of your screen&per.
You can also configure the XWorkplace PM hook to initiate
desktop switching in such cases if XPager is enabled&per.

:li.

:artwork name='xwsetup.bmp' runin align=left.Starting with V0&per.9&per.0, XWorkplace introduces
a new global settings object called :hp2."XWorkplace Setup":ehp2.&per.
This has a number of settings pages to monitor the status
of some XWorkplace internals, globally enable or disable
the major XWorkplace features that you might or might
not be interested in, and some more troubleshooting
settings&per. 
:p.
Those items are explained in detail when you press the
"Help" button on those new settings pages&per. 
.br
:li.

:artwork name='xfwps.bmp' runin align=left.The new :hp2."Workplace Shell":ehp2. object contains those pages
from the old "System" object which deal with the Workplace
Shell only&per. I felt these are not really "System"
settings and deserve a separate object&per. 
:p.
XWorkplace also adds most of its own settings pages
here, because these mostly affect the Workplace Shell&per.
This is described in more detail on the :link reftype=hd res=10083."Global Settings":elink.
page in this reference&per. 
.br
:li.

:artwork name='xclslist.bmp' runin align=left.There is another new object which contains the :hp2."WPS
Class List":ehp2.&per. This used to be on a settings page
in the "Workplace Shell" object before XWorkplace V0&per.9&per.0,
but that page proved to be a bit small to get all the
information in there&per. 
.br
:li.

:artwork name='xfsys.bmp' runin align=left.The new :hp2."OS/2 Kernel":ehp2. object contains those pages from
the old "System" object which deal with OS/2's internals,
e&per.g&per. the "Screen" settings&per. 
:p.
In this object you'll find several new settings pages
to change a number of settings in the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.CONFIG&per.SYS:font facename=default size=0x0.
file in the root directory of your boot drive&per. Since
these settings are a bit hard to remember and since
erroneous settings in this file might even lead to OS/2
not booting any more, XWorkplace tries to help you by
setting this up automatically&per. 
:p.
On each of these new settings pages, which will be explained
in more detail on the following pages, you will find
a button called "Update :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.CONFIG&per.SYS:font facename=default size=0x0." instead of the
usual "Undo" and "Default" buttons&per. Pressing this
button will cause the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.CONFIG&per.SYS:font facename=default size=0x0. file to be rewritten
according to the settings you've changed&per.

if you have :link reftype=hd res=10010.XPager:elink. enabled, several settings pages are
inserted here as well to configure XPager&per. 
:eul.

The :hp2.old "System" object:ehp2. continues to work, in case other
WPS enhancers try to insert anything into this object&per.
Such extensions will also appear in the new "OS/2 Kernel"
object, which inherits the "System" characteristics&per.

:p.
Please note that you should not open the old "System"
object and one of the new objects together to change
settings&per. The settings pages are not prepared for
this, and this might mess up the WPS settings&per.

Are you too annoyed too by the fact that double-clicking
on a URL or HTML file on your hard disk will always
start a new instance of NETSCAPE&per.EXE, although Netscape
is already running? This is a waste of time, memory,
and system resources&per. 
:p.
The :hp2.Netscape DDE Interface:ehp2. is the solution&per. You
can associate it with HTML and URL files, so that when
you double-click on them, either Netscape will be started
or, if it's already running, the HTML file or URL will
simply be passed to the running instance&per. 
:p.
NetscapeDDE should work with all of Netscape 2&per.02,
4&per.04, and 4&per.61 for OS/2&per. Since Mozilla presently
does not have DDE support (as of 2001-06-03), it won't

and :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.*&per.HTML:font facename=default size=0x0. files, and you can then double-click
on HTML files on your hard disk and have NetscDDE open
them&per.

Here's an unintended, but maybe useful side-effect&colon.
Since OS/2 can share its DDE environment with a Win-OS/2
session, NETSCDDE can even pass URLs to a running :hp2.Win-OS/2
copy:ehp2. of Netscape Navigator&per. This includes Communicator
(Netscape 4)&per. The only thing you have to do is enable
WIN_DDE in the Win-OS/2 session settings of your Windows
Netscape program object&per. By specifying your Windows
Netscape EXE file with :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.-p <exe>:font facename=default size=0x0. (see above), NETSCDDE&per.EXE
even provides for proper WPS integration of Windows
Netscapes&per. 
.br
:li.
You can now (V1&per.1) also specify a :hp2.&per.CMD file:ehp2.
with :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.-p:font facename=default size=0x0. and :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.-P:font facename=default size=0x0. to have certain commands executed before
and after Netscape is actually started&per. You should
specify the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.-m:font facename=default size=0x0. or :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.-mh:font facename=default size=0x0. options so that no ugly VIO window
appears&per. Here is an example :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.NETSCAPE&per.CMD:font facename=default size=0x0.&colon.

:cgraphic.@echo off
rem do some initialization here, e&per.g&per. change directory

the "Sound" page in that object to allow changing and
organizing system sounds more easily&per. 
:p.
In order to use this feature, you need to have the :hp2.XWPSound:ehp2.
replacement class installed&per. 
:p.
The main enhancement to the "Sound" page is the support
for :hp2."sound schemes",:ehp2. which IBM half-introduced with
OS/2 Warp 4&per. The main problem with sound schemes
was however that it was nearly impossible to define
one's own schemes without messing with the system INI
files directly&per. 
:p.
XWorkplace's new "Sound" page has a new interface which
allows you to quickly select a sound scheme, save your
current system sounds as a new sound scheme, and delete
existing schemes&per. I have designed this interface
to be similar to that of Windows 95, which, in this
one case, I consider quite well done&per. Since the
new "Sound" page handles sound schemes already, the
original "Sound schemes" page is no longer displayed&per.
:hp2.
:p.
Warp 3 users:ehp2. might be happy to find out that these sound
schemes now work on their operating system too&per.
To be more precise, the "Sound" page lets you :hp1.organize:ehp1.
your sounds on Warp 3 as well; however, you still won't
get sound scheme support in your Layout Palette (which,
on Warp 4 and higher, allows you to specify different
sounds for each folder)&per. 
:p.
Press :hp2."Help":ehp2. on the new "Sound" page to receive more
detailed instructions&per. :hp2.
:p.
Note&colon.:ehp2. System sounds are stored in the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.MMPM&per.INI:font facename=default size=0x0.
file in your :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.MMOS2:font facename=default size=0x0. directory, while sound schemes (for
some reason only IBM knows) are stored in :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.OS2SYS&per.INI:font facename=default size=0x0.&per.
I have stuck to this in order not to break compatibility&per.
As a consequence, however, all users on your system
share the same system sounds and sound schemes, even
if you have different Desktops (and :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.OS2&per.INI:font facename=default size=0x0. files)
for each user&per. Sorry, complain at IBM (as if that
helped)&per. 
:p.
The "Sound" object replacement works regardless of whether
you have enabled the new system sounds (see the :link reftype=hd res=10090.next
page:elink.)&per. 
:p.
If you want the "Sound" object replacement only, without
the new system sounds, disable "Extended system sounds"

A submenu appears which lists all available widget types&per.
Select one from that list, and a new widget will appear

can be used to display the contents of a folder (similar
to XFolder's :link reftype=hd res=10044.folder content menus:elink.), if the object is
a folder, or to quick-start an object in its default

:p.
The XCenter was designed to support plug-in DLLs&per.
This allows programmers to add new widget types (called
"widget classes") to the XCenter without having to actually
modify XWorkplace itself&per. 
:p.
As an example, let's say you are the developer of an
e-mail program&per. You could write a plug-in that periodically
checks the user's mail server for new mail&per. If any
is found, that widget could start flashing, and if the
user clicks on it, the e-mail client would be started
to retrieve the new mail&per. 
:p.
An XCenter widget is basically a PM window class, so
anybody who has written a PM program before should be
able to write an XCenter plug-in DLL&per. You do :hp1.not:ehp1.

:p.
First of all&colon. look into the :link reftype=hd res=10083."Workplace Shell":elink.
object, where you will find a lot of useful levers to
make XWorkplace behave&per. 
:p.
If you don't find the answer to your question here,
please look at XWorkplace's :link reftype=hd res=10025.web homepage:elink. also&per. I
am now maintaining a public bug list, which might answer
your question too&per. 
:ol compact.:li.
:hp2.Does XWorkplace slow down the WPS?:ehp2. 
:p.
Depends&per. Some features might cause a bit of a slowdown,
such as the first opening of a folder context menu,
since XWorkplace will have to read in the contents of
the Configuration Folder (including all subfolders)
to build the context menu accordingly&per. 
:p.
By contrast, some other features will actually speed
up the WPS&per. For example, the :link reftype=hd res=10049."Turbo folders":elink. feature
can dramatically speed up folders&per. Also, if extended
file associations are enabled, folder populating is
much faster because XWorkplace is using very efficient
caching routines for object handles internally&per.

:p.
Also, as opposed to some other WPS enhancers, XWorkplace
doesn't use excessive amounts of memory&per. I have
checked this once on my system, and in addition to the
size of the XWorkplace DLLs themselves, XWorkplace only
keeps a few 100 KBs of memory allocated and dynamically
frees storage when it's no longer needed&per. 
.br
:li.
:hp2.Why are the new system sounds not playing?:ehp2. 
:p.
You will need to install them first&per. See the :link reftype=hd res=10090.corresponding
page:elink. for more&per. 
:p.
Some people reported that after upgrading their sound
cards, XWorkplace's system sounds no longer works&per.
This turned out to be a problem with the multimedia
setup&per. Open the standard "Multimedia Configuration"
object, "Digital Audio" page, and make sure that the
"WAV" file extension appears in the extensions associations
list&per. 
.br
:li.
:hp2.Why do I keep getting crashes in SOM&per.DLL?:ehp2. 
:p.
If you're using :hp2.VisualAge C++:ehp2. or any other software
which installs SOM runtimes, make sure that :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.SOM&per.DLL:font facename=default size=0x0.
is loaded from :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.\OS2\DLL:font facename=default size=0x0.&per. This DLL has been updated
with more recent Warp fixpaks&per. VAC++ puts additional
directories at the beginning of the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.LIBPATH:font facename=default size=0x0. statement
in :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.CONFIG&per.SYS:font facename=default size=0x0., which still causes the old DLL to
be loaded&per. Put those directories behind :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.\OS2\DLL:font facename=default size=0x0.
in the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.LIBPATH:font facename=default size=0x0.&per.

:li.
:hp2.Why do I get Desktop restarts when I change media in
removeable drives (MO, ZIP, &per.&per.&per.)?:ehp2. 
:p.
I have no idea&per. Several people have reported very
strange WPS behavior when a drive folder is opened after
removeable media has been exchanged&per. After that,
the WPS works fine again (until the media is exchanged
again)&per. 
:p.
Note that I do not have removeable drives, other than
a CD-ROM drive and a CD writer&per. I therefore cannot
reproduce these problems here&per. If somebody can take
a look at XWorkplace's source code to find out what
might cause this, this would be a great help&per. 
:p.
IBM has introduced some new removeable media support
with Warp 4 Fixpak 6, so maybe we have a problem there&per.
Christian Hennecke <christian&per.hennecke@ruhr-uni-bochum&per.de>
wrote in some newsgroup that replacing :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.PMWP&per.DLL:font facename=default size=0x0.
with a pre-fixpak 6 version appears to help&per. You'll
also have to install NEWDASD, which should still be
available on Hobbes and Leo&per. 
.br
:li.
:hp2.Why do XWorkplace's features only work with some folders
and not with others?:ehp2. 
:p.
This is tricky&per. Some people have reported this in
all variations, i&per.e&per. hotkeys work for the Desktop
only, or not in URL folders, or not in Group Folders
(an IBM EWS utility), etc&per.pp&per.&per. The same
applies to status bars&per. 
:p.
From what I can see, this is related to folder subclassing&per.
XWorkplace needs certain window messages to introduce
these features, and if some other WPS class intercepts
these messages, XWorkplace's features behave funny or
cause crashes or do simply not work&per. 
:p.
In general, the more WPS class replacements you have
installed, the more likely these errors are likely to
appear&per. With a "clean" WPS, XWorkplace usually works
fine, but the people who have reported these errors
sometimes had four folder class replacements installed,
and it's really difficult for me to track down these
errors then&per. Try to de-install some WPS extensions
which you don't absolutely need&per. 
:p.
Also, the more messed up your INI files are, the more
likely the WPS is going to become unstable in general&per.
I strongly recommend Henk Kelder's :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WPTOOLS:font facename=default size=0x0. package,
which you should run from time to time anyway, to clean
up the INI files&per. This is still continually updated
and available at Hobbes&per. 
:p.
I have also found that installation order is important&per.
Some WPS extensions seem to simply "swallow" messages
which they don't need, assuming that they are the only
WPS extension on the system&per. (This might apply to
XWorkplace also, but I have tried to avoid this&per.)
Now, if XWorkplace comes before this greedy WPS extension
in the WPS class replacement list, which is the case
if XWorkplace was installed first, it does get the message
before the other WPS extension&per. 
.br

:hp2.Does XWorkplace cooperate with Object Desktop?:ehp2. 
:p.
In theory, yes&per. Practically, sometimes&per. For
details about this (and for other WPS utilities also),
see the separate :link reftype=hd res=10035."Compatibility":elink. page&per. 
.br
:li.
:hp2.Why do I hear the disk drives running every time I open
the "Drives" folder?:ehp2. 
:p.
The reason for this is that the XWorkplace status bars
query the free space on a drive&per. If the first object
in your "Drives" folder represents a floppy drive, it's
this drive that's queried&per. 
:p.
To avoid this, change the status bar information for
WPDisk objects in the "Workplace Shell" object, page
2 of "Status bars"&per. Then this information will not
be queried&per. 
:p.
Alternatively, you can disable status bars for the "Drives"
folder only on the "XFolder" page in the Drives folder's
settings notebook&per. 
.br
:li.
:hp2.Does XWorkplace run on Macintosh systems?:ehp2.

Shameless self-advertisement&colon. XWorkplace cooperates
perfectly with the fantastic :hp2.CommandPak:ehp2. from the same
author, available also at :link reftype=hd res=10100.xworkplace&per.org:elink.&per. This

:hp2.The WPS crashes/keeps rebooting after the Desktop restart&per.
What is this?:ehp2. 
:p.
Difficult to say&per. If it keeps rebooting, this is
a sure sign that the WPS is trapping, i&per.e&per. exceptions
occur when it's booting up&per. Same thing as on the
:link reftype=hd res=10095.previous page:elink., XWorkplace seems to be conflicting with
other WPS extensions&per. 
:p.
Otherwise, it might simply be that restarting the WPS
is not working on your system&per. The Desktop restart
is only intended as a shortcut, but if it doesn't work,
try rebooting instead&per. 
:p.
Some people have reported that removing XWorkplace INI
keys seems to help&per. Take some INI editor and look
in OS2&per.INI for application names starting with "XFolder"&per.
Delete them all&per. XWorkplace does not :hp1.rely:ehp1. on INI
keys any more&per. This will delete all your settings
and reset the language to English, but maybe XWorkplace
will run&per. 
:p.
In addition, it is always recommended to have more recent
OS/2 fixpaks applied, that is, at least Fixpak 35 for
Warp 3 and fixpak 5 for Warp 4&per. XWorkplace will
run without fixpaks, but this might lead to problems&per.
IBM has changed many things with the SOM kernel over
time, which the WPS uses for its class management&per.
I have tried my best to enhance compatibility, but I
cannot test all possible configurations myself&per.
I have found, for example, that the standard Warp 3
SOM kernel is extremely buggy, so at least for Warp
3 I :hp1.strongly:ehp1. recommend applying fixpaks&per.

will do the job&per.

On Warp 4 and higher, there is a new setting in the
"System" object in the "System Setup" folder&per. You
should find it on the "Menu" tab&per. This setting is

The :hp2.folder content functions:ehp2. are helpful, but can crowd
your context menus too much also if you declare many
folders to be your favorites&per. On my system, I have
created a separate folder called "frequent", which I
have declared to be my only favorite folder&per. In
this folder, I can put all those folders which I frequently
access, so I only have one context menu entry, but a

:hp2.When I select a context menu item, not the XWorkplace
function, but some other function gets executed&per.

Probably a menu ID conflict with some other WPS extension&per.
This is a known problem with Network logins&per. Go
to the "XWorkplace Configuration", "Paranoia" page,
and raise the "Menu item ID offset"&per. Press "Help"
there for details&per. With V0&per.9&per.0, the default

:hp2.When I open a context menu, my system crashes/hangs&per.
What can I do?:ehp2. 
:p.
Versions prior to V0&per.82 served as a test for video
drivers in this respect&per. ;-) I have found out that
some video drivers do not support transparent background
mix for bitmaps, which XFolder used to use&per. While
some drivers silently ignored the transparency, other
drivers crashed badly and stopped the whole system (especially
Matrox Millenium)&per. With V0&per.82, I have changed
the icon painting for folder content menus to use regular
icons instead of bitmaps&per. Icon painting is still
disabled per default in case something should still
go wrong&per. Turn on "Show icons" on the "Context menus"
pages in "Workplace Shell" to enable icon painting&per.

:p.
If you still have problems, Ralph Scharpf reported that
one could install the IBM GRADD drivers for MGA video
cards instead, which appear to be working&per. Unfortunately,
those cards do not support 1024x768 with more than 60
Hz, but if you can live with 800x600, this appears to
be a solution&per. 
.br
:li.
:hp2.Why do folder content menus not work with folders on
the Launchpad?:ehp2. 
:p.
Because the Launchpad is not a folder&per. XWorkplace
can only subclass the default folder window procedure
to receive important system messages when menus are
being opened, which is when the variable menu items
are inserted into context menus&per. Since the Launchpad
does not use the folder's default window procedure,
XWorkplace cannot easily subclass it either&per. 
.br
:li.
:hp2.I have added something to the config folder, but it
doesn't appear in the menus&per. Is this a compatibility
conflict?:ehp2. 
:p.
Probably no&per. Since V0&per.70, XWorkplace uses the
:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.&per.ICONPOS:font facename=default size=0x0. extended attributes of the config folder
and its subfolders to determine the order of objects
in a folder&per. Trouble is, these are only written
by the WPS when the folder is closed, and only if the
folder was open in Icon or Details view&per. So simply
open the folder in Details view and close it again&per.
That should work&per. 
.br
:li.
:hp2.How do I get the underlined characters in menu items
for keyboard shortcuts?:ehp2. 
:p.
Put a tilde character (:font facename='Courier' size=18x12."~":font facename=default size=0x0.) in front of a certain character
in the program object's title&per. This will underline
the following character in the menu entry, allowing
you to type this character as a keyboard shortcut when
the context menu is displayed&per. 
:p.
(This is different from the :link reftype=hd res=10053.folder hotkeys:elink. which XWorkplace
adds to open folders&per.) 
:p.
Example&colon. :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.OS/2 ~command window:font facename=default size=0x0. will make "c" a
keyboard shortcut in the context menu&per. 
:p.
For this, be sure to check "Suppress ''~'' in window
title" in the :link reftype=hd res=10083."Workplace Shell":elink. object on the "Context
menus" pages&per.

:li.
:hp2.I have added a program object to the config folder,
but when I select the menu item, I get error messages
from the program&per. What am I doing wrong?:ehp2. 
:p.
You will probably need to put a :font facename='Courier' size=18x12."%":font facename=default size=0x0. character into the
"Parameters" field of the program object to prevent
XWorkplace from passing the folder as a parameter&per.

:li.
:hp2.I have added a shadow to the config folders, but opening
it doesn't work like with the other objects&per. What
am I doing wrong?:ehp2. 
:p.
XWorkplace does open shadows of program objects in the
configuration folders, but it does not change their
directories or parameters&per. This is not a bug, it's
an intentional limitation for security&per. COPY your
program objects to the configuration folders instead
of creating shadows&per. See the context help for the

:hp2.I have deleted the XWorkplace Configuration Folder&per.
How do I get it back?:ehp2. 
:p.
With V0&per.9&per.1, this behavior has changed because
many people have complained about XFolder's behavior
when the Configuration Folder was missing&per. So to
recreate that folder, go to the "Object" page in the

:h2 res=10098 x=right width=70%.FAQ: XShutdown Questions
:p.

:ol compact.:li.
:hp2.Why does automatic reboot not work on my system?:ehp2. 
:p.
I don't know, on some systems it just doesn't, for example
my Warp 3 with FixPak 35, but it does on my Warp 4&per.
I was unable to figure out what the reason for this
is, but a few users have also reported this, and the
problem also occurs with the WarpEnhancer reboot feature,
so I guess it's not XWorkplace's fault&per. (The reboot
feature uses an undocumented IOCtl to :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.DOS&per.SYS:font facename=default size=0x0. anyway,
so there is probably no guarantee by IBM that it will
always work&per.) If you have the IBM BootManager installed,
you can circumvent this problem by specifying :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.SETBOOT&per.EXE:font facename=default size=0x0.
as a user reboot option (Desktop settings notebook ->
"XDesktop" page 1 -> "Actions")&per. 
.br
:li.
:hp2.Is there anything which XShutdown does not properly
save?:ehp2. 
:p.
Yes&per. XShutdown does not save positions of folders
which have changed just before XShutdown was initiated,
because the WPS :hp1.delays:ehp1. saving folder positions in some
background thread to which I have found no access, and
the format of the folder position entries in OS2&per.INI
is not documented, so I cannot do it myself&per. The
same applies to folders which are closed by XShutdown
itself&per. If you want folder positions to be saved,
close them manually and wait a few (about 10-20) seconds
before starting XShutdown&per. 
:p.
(With "folder positions", I mean the position of an
open folder :hp1.window:ehp1. itself, not the positions of the
icons in a folder&per. These are properly saved&per.)

:p.
Also, XShutdown cannot save changes to the Tasklist
window (e&per.g&per. fonts or colors being dropped on
them)&per. If you want these changes saved, you'll have
to use OS/2's regular shutdown just once&per. 
.br
:li.
:hp2.Why do I keep getting errors while the INI files are
being saved?:ehp2. 
:p.
This is one of the all time favorites, and the problem
has changed with several releases&per. 
:ul compact.:li.
With early versions :hp2.before XFolder 0&per.85,:ehp2. this was
mostly due to INI keys which do not contain any data,
which shouldn't happen&per. This has been fixed a long
while ago&per. 
.br
:li.
Still, many people reported these errors to occur pretty
randomly, even with INI keys which :hp1.do:ehp1. contain data&per.
I was finally able to track this down to occur with
pretty large INI files&per. I suspect that basically
the problem sits in PM itself, since the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WinGetLastError:font facename=default size=0x0.
API frequently returns :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.PMERR_MEMORY_ALLOCATION_ERR:font facename=default size=0x0.,
which is cooly described in the PM reference with "An
error occured during memory management&per."&per. I
believe that with large INI files, PM runs out of shared
memory, which is used for INI file management&per. The
limit above which the errors start to occur is dependent
on how much shared memory is already used on the respective
machine, but it's usually way above 1 MB per INI file&per.

:p.
Basically, :hp2.before V0&per.9&per.5,:ehp2. XWorkplace used PrfOpenProfile
to create a new INI file (for the user and system INI
file, respectively) and then went through all applications
and keys in the profile and simply copied them&per.
This caused quite some stress on the PM shared memory
management&per. 
:p.
Reducing the size of the INI files did help&per. By
the way, it was not only XShutdown which fails on these
INIs, but any other application which copies the user
and system profiles bytewise also (I've checked this
with WPSBackup once, which just crashes)&per. 
:p.
To reduce the size of the INIs, first of all, run CHECKINI
(from Henk Kelder's WPTOOLS package) to have all invalid
entries removed&per. In addition, use any INI editor
to manually delete the following keys which can grow
very large :hp1.(make a backup of your INIs before doing
this)&colon.:ehp1. 
:ul compact.:li.
:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.PM_Abstract&colon.Icons:font facename=default size=0x0.&colon. this contains the icons
for all abstract objects&per. By deleting this key,
you will lose all user-defined icons for abstract objects,
but in many cases, the data in here is redundant, because
e&per.g&per. program objects use the executable's icon
per default anyway&per. :li.
:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.PM_Workplace&colon.FolderPos:font facename=default size=0x0.&colon. this holds the window
positions of all the folders that were ever opened by
the WPS, even if a folder was last opened five years
ago&per. You will lose all your folder positions when
deleting this, but except for maybe a dozen folders
this should be acceptable, and for those, you can quickly
resize them again&per. 
:eul.
:p.
:li.
With :hp2.V0&per.9&per.5,:ehp2. I have rewritten the routines so
the PM APIs are no longer used for creating the new
profiles&per. Since Carsten Arnold told me the file
format of the INI files, I wrote a set of routines which
write these without using shared memory&per. Apparently,
this helped&per. This is the "new method" which is now
selectable on the "XShutdown" page in the Desktop's
settings notebook&per. 
:eul.
:p.

.br
:li.
:hp2.After using Xhutdown, at the next reboot, the screen
is reset to VGA, and I get a dialog saying that the
Desktop could not be found&per. What is this?:ehp2. 
:p.
This is the same problem as described in the previous
question&per. Obviously, your INI files have not been
properly saved&per. As a result, OS/2 reverts to default
values for the screen and cannot find your desktop&per.

:p.
If this happens, you will find a backup copy of both
OS2&per.INI and OS2SYS&per.INI in your \OS2 directory,
renamed to &per.BAK&per. Before XShutdown saves the
INI files, it renames the old ones&per. Boot to a command
line (using Alt-F1 during startup) and rename these
two backups back to *&per.INI&per. 
.br
:li.
:hp2.Why is APM power-off is not working on my system?:ehp2. 
:p.
I don't know&per. On some systems, it just doesn't&per.
I'm pretty sure it's not XWorkplace's fault because
XWorkplace does nothing but calling into the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.APM&per.SYS:font facename=default size=0x0.
device driver, after which it has no control over what
that driver is doing to power off the system&per. 
:p.
IBM updated the APM APM support with Warp 4 Fixpak 6
(and possibly later too)&per. The "XShutdown" page in
the Desktop's settings notebook displays the version
number of the installed APM driver, which should be
at least 1&per.2 to make APM power-off work&per. 
:p.
Even worse, there are many systems which have no 100%
compatible APM support in the BIOS, and this might be
the problem too&per. 
.br
:li.
:hp2.APM power-off works, but at the next reboot I am getting
CHKDSKs&per.:ehp2. 
:p.
Again, XWorkplace can't do much about this&per. I am
getting these CHKDSKs too on my laptop, even though
it's working fine on my desktop machine&per. Apparently
:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.APM&per.SYS:font facename=default size=0x0. does not wait long enough for some hard
disk with large internal caches to flush their caches
to disk before the system power is killed&per. This
appears to be a generic problem which I've also read
about with Win95, so you'll probably have to disable
APM altogether in this case&per.

There are a number of files in the different subdirectory

be useful to you&colon. 
:ul compact.:li.
:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.:hp2.BOOTMGR&per.CMD:ehp2.:font facename=default size=0x0. is new with V0&per.83&per. This script
was supplied by Duane A&per. Chamblee <duanec@ibm&per.net>
and will automatically add all the current BootManager
choices to the XWorkplace user-reboot actions for XShutdown&per.
This is done by modifying the XWorkplace keys in OS2&per.INI
directly&per. No guarantee that this will actually work
on your system! 
.br

:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.:hp2.CROBJxxx&per.CMD:ehp2.:font facename=default size=0x0. (with xxx being a three-digit language
code, as described in :link reftype=hd res=10039.National Language Support:elink.) are
used by XWorkplace to create the default Configuration
Folders&per. These are just plain REXX scripts which
create a number of objects on your desktop&per. 
:p.
These scripts are called both after XWorkplace has been
installed (after the first Desktop restart) and also
whenever XWorkplace fails to locate its Configuration
Folder&per. 
:p.
You may modify these scripts to have a different default
configuration created&per. However, you should be very
careful in changing the various object settings, especially
the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.OBJECTID:font facename=default size=0x0. keywords, because XWorkplace might rely
on these&per. 
.br

templates,:elink. but this script is still included, for those
who got used to it&per. 
:p.
It needs the following parameters on the command line&colon.

:cgraphic.newobj <wpsclass> <name>
:ecgraphic.

It will create a new instance of :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.<wpsclass>:font facename=default size=0x0. with
the title :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.<name>:font facename=default size=0x0. in the current directory&per.
Please see the :link reftype=hd res=10099."WPS Classes" page:elink. for a list of WPS

objects though&per. 
:p.
Here's an example&colon. 
:cgraphic.newobj WPFolder New_Folder

:h2 res=10101 x=right width=70%.About XWorkplace Version Numbering
:p.
With the release of XWorkplace V0&per.9&per.0, the :hp2.version
numbering format has been altered&per.:ehp2. Similar to the
Linux version numbering, we now have three sub-digits
in the version number, which is now in the format :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.major&per.minor&per.revision:font facename=default size=0x0.&per.

:p.
As with Linux, :hp2.odd minor numbers:ehp2. are used for "developer
releases" which are not guaranteed to be stable&per.
After several developer releases, if the code is considered
to be stable, the next version will get an :hp2.even minor
number&per.:ehp2. 
:p.
So version 1&per.0&per.0 means that the code is considered
ready for general use&per.

#64) 
.br
:li.
Turbo folders&colon. Removed the "extended associations"
setting, which is now combined with the "turbo folders"
setting&per. Using only one of them proved to make the
system unstable, and this turned out to be impossible
to fix without a lot of effort&per. 
.br
:li.
Folder split views&colon. Sped up emptying containers
on folder change&per. (Bug #270) 
.br

XCenter&colon. made introductory help a global setting&per.

.br
:li.
XCenter&colon. Removed the xwhealth widget from the
distribution, since the author has a more up-to-date
version on his web page and no longer supplies me with
updates&per. The one from previous versions should still
work&per. 
:eul.
:p.

Font folder&colon. Fixed wrong error message&per. (Bug
#36)

maximized windows without overlapping&per. (Bug #246)

XCenter&colon. Object buttons that pointed to now invalid
objects would cause internal traps in PM because the
icon handle was wrong&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
XCenter&colon. Tray widget now remembers background
color&per. (Bug #58)

XCenter&colon. Changing top/bottom location of XCenter
wrongly set a screen border action&per. Fixed&per. (Bug

:p.
Yes, 1&per.0&per.0 is out&per. 
:p.
As a general change, this release will most probably
no longer run on Warp 3 since I am overriding quite
a number of WPS methods now that are specific to OS/2
Warp 4&per. I was getting tired of hacking around menu
specifics for Warp 4 and am now using Warp 4's interfaces
for that&per. 
:p.
I have gotten no reports about Warp 3 recently so I
assume this will not break XWorkplace for a lot of people&per.
To those who are still running Warp 3, I am sorry, but
Warp 4 is six years old by now as well and it should
be possible to get it cheap somewhere&per. Otherwise,
stick with XWorkplace V0&per.9&per.20&per. :hp2.
:p.
XWorkplace 1&per.0&per.0 (November 24, 2002):ehp2. 
:p.
New features&colon. 
:ul compact.:li.
Common&colon. Added "Report bug" button to XWorkplace
product info dialog&per. :hp2.Please use that button for
all bug reports from now on&per.:ehp2. Thank you&per. 
.br
:li.
Startup&colon. XWorkplace is now checking the WPS's
class replacements list on startup to make sure that
XFldObject is the first replacement of WPObject&per.
This should fix the problems with the "Speech" tab missing
when VoiceType is installed, hopefully&per. 
.br
:li.
Folder split views&per. Enable them in "XWorkplace Setup"
and select "Split view" from a folder's "open" menu&per.

.br
:li.
OS/2 Kernel, program files&colon. bldlevel parser can
now handle the weird format that is used by IBM TCP/IP&per.

.br
:li.
Disks&colon. Fixed a bunch of weirdos in the WPS disk
context menus&per. For one, the IBM peer class replacements
kept showing the "drive not ready" hard error TWICE
when requesting the context menu for a drive with no
media&per. Secondly, the WPS seemed to be using the
system uptime to determine whether "Lock" and "Eject"
should be shown for removeable disks&per. "Lock" and
"Eject" are now always shown&per. Both features are
only enabled when the "Replace drive not ready" feature
is enabled, for security&per. 
.br
:li.
XPager&colon. Martin Lafaix added "Sticky" menu option
to system menus&per. 
:eul.
:p.
Miscellaneous changes&colon. 
:ul compact.:li.
Common&colon. Rewrote large parts of the dialog formatter
to allow for easier handling of nested subtables in
dialog descriptions&per. 
.br
:li.
Common&colon. Me smartass finally figured out that declaring
functions as "static" will never put them into the linker's
map files&per. As a result, they didn't end up the SYM
files either, which made XWorkplace's trap logs a lot
less informative&per. Fixed, I removed all "static"
declarations for now&per. :hp2.Note&colon.:ehp2. I discovered a
problem with XWorkplace's SYM files since XFLDR&per.DLL
has finally become too big to handle all the symbols&per.
As a result, the trap logs might contain some garbage
lines&per. I am still thinking about how to fix this&per.

.br
:li.
Folder menus&colon. Rewrote and adjusted large parts
of the internal menu hacks to get split views to work&per.
I hope this hasn't broken anything for the default (icon,
tree, details) folder views&per. 
.br
:li.
Folder menus&colon. Turned "Copy filename" into a submenu
to get rid of the unintuitive shift-click thing and
added a few more menu items if multiple files are selected&per.

.br
:li.
Folder hotkeys&colon. Martin Lafaix rewrote the respective
page in "Workplace Shell"&per. 
:eul.
:p.
Bugfixes&colon. 
:ul compact.:li.
Common&colon. Executable header parser was completely
broken for files without extensions (e&per.g&per. OS2KRNL)&per.
Fixed; "Module" page now displays correctly&per. 
.br
:li.
Common&colon. XWorkplace kept the default OS/2 shutdown
from finishing, at least with IBM MCP2&per. Fixed&per.

.br
:li.
Common&colon. Changed a a number of places that requested
object mutexes too frequently and made them use private
mutexes instead&per. That fixed several situations where
the WPS deadlocked because of mutexes requested in reverse
order by two different threads&per. Among others, this
fixes the hangs during installation (instl001&per.cmd)
on SMP and when dragging attachments from PMMail to
the Desktop&per. Thanks to Knut St&per. Osmundsen for
helping with debugging this&per. 
.br
:li.
Folders&colon. "Create new" from template in config
folder never worked really well in Tree views&per. Fixed
a few things&per. 
.br
:li.
Folders&colon. Status bars produced vertical scroll
bars for all folders that had "always sort" off&per.
Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Folders&colon. Paul Ratcliffe fixed several duplicate
menu items and added a config option for "Restart Desktop"&per.

.br
:li.
Folders&colon. If always sort was off, scroll bars would
keep popping up randomly&per. Fixed, I hope&per. 
.br
:li.
Folder hotkeys&colon. Martin Lafaix rewrote the settings
page in "Workplace Shell"&per. 
.br
:li.
Folder hotkeys&colon. Disabled select by name, select
all, and deselect all for Tree views finally&per. 
.br
:li.
Folder sort&colon. Settings were quite broken for newly
created folders sometimes&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Select by name, Batch rename&colon. Always popped up
twice when invoked from a context menu&per. Fixed; added
folder title to dialog title while I was at it&per.

.br
:li.
Startup and Shutdown folders&colon. Folder titles were
never localized&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Folder painting&colon. "shadow icons" produced strange
display for shadowed folders in Tree view&per. Fixed&per.

.br
:li.
Extended associations&colon. "Export" facility did not
escape attribute values like &amp. properly&per. Fixed&per.

.br
:li.
Extended associations&colon. After setting the icon
of a data file object, changing its title would replace
the custom icon with that of the associated program&per.
Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
File operations&colon. If deletion of a data file failed,
e&per.g&per. because it was currently used, the WPS
object was removed anyway without an error message&per.
Fixed, added meaningful error messages also&per. 
.br
:li.
File dialog&colon. Mostly reimplemented to share the
new split view code&per. 
.br
:li.
Programs&colon. Fixed problems with %* replacements&per.
For one, %**N and the like are now case-insensitive
(as with the WPS, that is, %**n is recognized also)&per.
Secondly, XWorkplace put quotes around %* placeholders
(including %**N and the like) when the result had spaces,
but the WPS doesn't&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Programs&colon. Replacement icon code for program objects
never looked for &per.ICON EAs with executable, but
always searched the executable resources only&per. Among
others, PMView suffered from this, displaying a dull
standard PM icon&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Programs&colon. Knut St&per. Osmundsen fixed some problems
with passing environments on program startup&per. 
.br
:li.
XCenter&colon. Mostly rewrote pulse widget graph painting
to fix the vertical lines on the left if a high load
was displayed&per. Optimized the code at the same time
to save a few hundered Gpi* calls&per. 
.br
:li.
WPS class list&colon. crashed when selecting an orphaned
WPS class&per. Bug was introduced with 0&per.9&per.20,
fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
OS/2 Kernel&colon. Syslevels page didn't find syslevel
files if they were not on the boot drive&per. Fixed,
we now search the PATH for where the networking components
might be&per. 
.br
:li.
OS/2 Kernel, program files&colon. bldlevel display missed
single-character substrings in extended bldlevel format
(e&per.g&per. DANIS506&per.ADD)&per. Fixed&per.

Hook&colon. Martin Lafaix fixed a few weirdos with auto-hide
mouse&per.

Documented XWPString setup strings&per. Added XWPString
NOSTRINGPAGE setup string&per. Added XFldDesktop SHOWHELPPANEL

Giant WPS help rework&per. XWorkplace can now replace
most default WPS help panels&per. This can be disabled

.br
:li.
Extended associations&colon. Added icon sharing&per.
If the icon of a program object is changed, all data
files using that object's icon are finally properly
refreshed&per. The feature is enabled automatically
with extended associations and works only with them,
unfortunately&per. To quote Achim HasenmÅller&colon.
"I've been waiting for that functionality since OS/2
2&per.0 beta&per."&per. 
.br

Extended associations&colon. Added a new setting to
"File types" page that allows you to disable passing
the object handle of a data file to the environment
of the associated program&per. 
.br
:li.
File operations&colon. Added replacement "Paste" dialog
(from "Edit" menu) because I finally got sick of the
default WPS one&per. The replacement can be enabled
on the "Features" page as well&per. 
.br
:li.
Folders&colon. Added lazy icon loading for folder populate,
which makes folders show icons much more quickly initially
and loads the real object icons asynchronously on a
separate thread&per. This can be enabled in "Workplace
Shell", "Folder Views" page and should work even if
turbo folders or extended associations are disabled&per.

XCenter&colon. Window list widget has a "Filter" menu

XPager&colon. Selecting "Properties" from the pager

Common&colon. XWorkplace no longer holds all messages

.br
:li.
Common&colon. Greatly optimized nlsUpper, my helper
func for upper-casing a string that gets called from
nearly everywhere&per. 
.br
:li.
Common&colon. Optimized a lot of internal management
routines to use less memory and no longer use the XWorkplace
heap by moving linked list pointers into object instance
memory&per. Awake objects management is no longer done
by the Worker thread either&per. 
.br
:li.
Common&colon. Optimized my object destruction mechanism
to no longer use SOM name lookup method resolution,
since I found a way to handle undocumented WPS methods
better&per. 
.br
:li.
Common&colon. Rewrote the XWorkplace "Product info"
dialog as a testcase for linking from my rich text control&per.

.br

File operations&colon. Reworked replacement "File exists"
dialog&per. 
.br

Replacement refresh&colon. Tweaked thread priorities
a bit to catch more file-system notifications&per. 
.br
:li.
Turbo folders&colon. Tweaked thread priorities a bit
to work better on uni-processor systems&per. 
.br

Trash can&colon. Is now smart enough to use DosForceDelete
in order not to move all files to DELDIR (if enabled)
on emptying the trash can&per. 
.br
:li.
XCenter&colon. Reworked all widget context menus to
make them more accessible&per.

XShutdown&colon. On "Restart Desktop", if "close all
sessions" is off, pager recovers only WPS windows to
current screen, while others keep running on their own
screens&per.

objects&per.

in XWorkplace with a DBCS-enabled version, of which
I do not know whether it actually works&per. I'd be
grateful if Asian testers could check whether the bugs
that have been reported are fixed by this since, again,
I have no way of testing DBCS here&per. 
.br
:li.
Common&colon. Replaced most wpQueryDefaultHelp overrides
with wpclsQueryDefaultHelp overrides for changing a
class's default help&per. The previous implementation
broke instance help assigned via HELPLIBRARY and HELPPANEL&per.

.br
:li.
Common&colon. Fixed rare synchronization problems when
objects were renamed and views sometimes not updated
properly&per. 
.br
:li.
Common&colon. Fixed a nasty object ID problem that would
cause CHECKINI to report lots of bad object IDs when
objects were created from the "Create new" folder menu&per.

.br
:li.
Common&colon. Fixed a problem during object deletion
that could cause the object to re-add information to
the INI files&per. This was probably the cause for CHECKINI
to report abstract objects that had been deleted by
XWorkplace&per. 
.br
:li.
Common&colon. All XWorkplace message boxes were lacking
the top-right "Close" button&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
"Icon" page replacement&colon. Fixed excessive rename
when page was first opened&per. 
.br

Program objects&colon. Command line icons were broken
(in "Command Prompts" folder), and batch files and Win-OS/2
full screen objects didn't work at all&per. Fixed&per.

File operations&colon. Replacement "File exists" dialog
never respected the auto-rename or auto-replace settings
on the "Title" page in "Workplace Shell"&per. Fixed&per.

Folders&colon. Hotkey for "Select by name" (per default,
Ctrl+S) broke with V0&per.9&per.19&per. Fixed&per.

Folders&colon. Folder hotkey descriptions were either
wrong or missing in the items in the menu bar pulldowns&per.
Fixed, hopefully&per. 
.br
:li.
Extended associations&colon. Got rid of the internal
types cache that ate up lots of memory and had synchronization
problems anyway, leading to wrong associations sometimes&per.
Extended assocs are thus slightly slower now when folders
are populated, but it's barely noticeable&per. 
.br
:li.
Extended associations&colon. Fixed a bug in my object
handles cache where sometimes the wrong object got thrown
out of the cache&per. 
.br
:li.
Turbo folders&colon. Plugged a few more holes where
the WPS succeeded in destroying object icons that were
assigned by XWorkplace, leading to blank icons&per.

.br
:li.
Replacement refresh&colon. Fixed a system deadlock in
the rare situation that an object was made awake from
the refresh thread that had an association icon that
was not previously used and thus had to be loaded first&per.

Trash can / replacement delete&colon. Plugged another
hole where the WPS kept producing file-system handles
for objects just before deleting them&per. The handles
stayed in OS2SYS&per.INI forever, of course&per. This
was especially expensive when a folder with many subfolders
was deleted&per.

handle, double-clicking on the setup string object crashed
XWorkplace&per. Fixed&per.

Sound object&colon. Sound scheme testing was case-sensitive,

XShutdown&colon. Partitions listed on the "Partitions"
button in the user reboot actions dialog were truncated
to 8 characters, but LVM allows 20&per. Fixed&per.

XPager&colon. Stay on top would never work, fixed&per.

.br
:li.
XPager&colon. If "Show secondary windows" was on, you

.br
:li.
XCenter&colon. X-Button widget supports user bitmaps
now (open properties to set them)&per. 
.br
:li.
XCenter&colon. Per default, an XCenter makes itself
a screen border object automatically now&per. This can
be disabled in the settings notebook&per. 
.br
:li.
XCenter&colon. Widget context menus have "Close" menu
item now&per. 
.br
:li.
XCenter&colon. WIDGETS setup strings supports trays
now&per. It is finally possible to set up a complete
XCenter via setup strings&per. Note that the format
has slightly changed; see the help for the object "Details"
button on the "Icon" page for details&per. Changed the
default XCenter setup while I was at it&per. 
.br
:li.
OS/2 Kernel&colon. Added a couple more SYSLEVEL files&per.

.br
:li.
Hook&colon. Added "Center over button-less dialogs"
to auto-move pointer feature (Martin Lafaix)&per. 
.br
:li.
XPager&colon. Reworked pager window display to allow
for shaded colors in background and showing the program
icons as well&per. 
.br

XPager&colon. Sticky window criteria are now much better;
"Undo" works now too (Martin Lafaix)&per. Also included
regular expressions support&per. 
.br

NetscapeDDE&colon. uses default browser settings from
WPUrl object now, if not overridden from the command
line (Yuri Dario)&per.

Common&colon. Found a way to give dialog windows a close
button too&per.

:li.
Startup&colon. Much more detailed startup log which
might help debugging WPS startup problems&per. Changed
log file name to WPSTART&per.LOG&per. 
.br
:li.
Config folders&colon. The restriction that shadows to
program objects in the config folders were not treated
like program objects (for the special program object
features) has been lifted&per. It is no longer necessary
to copy program objects for that reason&per. 
.br
:li.
Folder content menus&colon. folder templates are no
longer sorted with the other folders&per. 
.br
:li.

delete" setting&per. Added a checkbox to trash can instead&per.

.br
:li.
File operations&colon. Reversed confirmations for "move
to trash" and "empty trash"&per. The real delete operation
is to move something to the trash can; it really doesn't
make sense to have every object confirmed when the trash
can is emptied later&per. 
.br
:li.
XCenter&colon. Single click on empty space in tray widget
will change trays now&per. 
.br
:li.
XCenter&colon. Made Diskfree (WarpCenter style) widget
sizeable to avoid the permanent resizing&per. 
.br
:li.
XCenter&colon. Rewrote large parts of the window list
widget, which no longer scans the window list itself,
but uses XWPDAEMN&per.EXE instead&per. For one, this
allows sharing the window list code between XPager and
the window list widget; most importantly though, the
window list no longer blocks the PM SIQ if a window
doesn't care to respond to WM_QUERYICON&per. Added half-toned
display for minimized and hidden windows as well&per.

.br
:li.
XShutdown&colon. We no longer recover Windows to the
current desktop and run the shutdown folder for "restart
Desktop", but only for actual system shutdown&per.

There is now no legacy PageMage code left in XPager&per.
Optimized window list scanning to use an additional
background thread and to allow sharing the window list
with the XCenter window list widget&per. 
:eul.
:p.
Bugfixes&colon. 
:ul compact.:li.
Common&colon. Some internal initialization code didn't
get called for folders, which was the reason why renaming
them neither refreshed their container record nor awake
shadows properly&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Common&colon. Fixed global variables which caused many
dialogs to fail after NLS change&per. Also localized
a few more hard-coded strings&per. 
.br
:li.
Common&colon. If NLS DLL cannot be found, XWorkplace
will automatically fall back to English NLS now&per.
Of course this doesn't work if English is broken, but
then XWorkplace is hosed anyway&per. 
.br
:li.
Common&colon. Lots of rework on dialog manager to fix
display oddities on resolutions lower than 1024x768&per.

programs, which should help with applications hanging
the system&per.

provoked a cryptic error message&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Programs&colon. Added a missing mutex semaphore which

Folders&colon. Details views weren't refresh properly
during refresh&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Folders&colon. Turbo folders had a few situations where
real name changes weren't picked up properly, leading
to duplicate or misnamed objects&per. Among other things,
this could affect objects when the "Title clash" dialog
popped up&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Folder auto-refresh&colon. Fixed a couple cases where
refresh notifications were confused&per. 
.br
:li.
Folder content menus&colon. Text wasn't centered vertically

other WPProgram subclasses&per. Also fixed wrong association
icons for WPUrl objects&per. 
.br

.br
:li.
File operations&colon. Title clash dialog no longer
appears when creating shadows&per.

File operations&colon. Trash can crashed when deleting
several objects with the same title&per. Fixed&per.

.br
:li.
File dialog replacement&colon. Double-clicking on object
in right container didn't work&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Fonts folder&colon. Installing fonts via drag and drop
crashed the WPS internally&per. I'm not sure if the
bug was in 0&per.9&per.18 or if I introduced it later,
but it's working now anyway&per. 
.br
:li.
XCenter&colon. Largely rewrote widget creation and drag-n-drop
code to handle dragging widgets between XCenters, including
trays&per. Apparently this also fixed malpositioned
widgets in some situations&per. 
.br
:li.
XCenter&colon. Object button and X-button widgets crashed
PM bad when objects from other processes were dragged
over them&per. Fixed&per.

correctly when hatching was supposed to disappear&per.
Fixed&per.

Object button widgets are no longer shown in the "Add

for better contrast&per. 
.br
:li.
Saved a precious PM timer in the Worker thread that
was used for close to nothing&per.

File pages replacement&colon. Now refreshing page when
page is turned back to&per. 
.br
:li.
Program objects&colon. Fixed a bunch of problems with
programs not remembering setting changes and the bug
that program objects could no longer be properly created
at all&per. That was a hard one&per. Added exception
handling to a number of replacement methods too since
apparently the code crashed sometimes&per. Parts of
this code were and are active even if extended associations
were disabled&per. 
.br
:li.
Programs&colon. Fixed memory problems with my WinStartApp
wrapper which sometimes ate parts of the environment
of the process to be started&per. (The code was and
is active only if extended associations are enabled&per.)

.br
:li.
Programs&colon. Fixed hangs with VIO programs when not
started from thread 1&per. 
.br
:li.
Folder sorting / status bars&colon. Hopefully fixed
the mysterious scroll bars that would pop up in folder
icon views (in "as placed" mode) if "always sort" was
off for a folder&per. 
.br
:li.
Folder sorting&colon. "Sort by class" and "type" would
never sort if two objects had the same class or type&per.
Fixed, now falling back to sort by name for those cases&per.

objects in tree view plus frequent bad scrolling&per.

XWorkplace should check the desktop's integrity on startup,
since so many people had problems with it&per. Added
a corresponding flag to the "Panic" dialog also&per.

:eul.
:p.
Bugfixes&colon. 
:ul compact.:li.
XWorkplace's "Check desktop" feature would report a
broken desktop even if only a single handle in the file-system
handles table was broken&per. Instead, XWorkplace now
gives you a different warning for that, allowing you
to display the "Panic" dialog instead and run xfix from
there&per. 
.br
:li.
After the dialog that popped up to tell XWorkplace about
the Desktop's location, the Desktop would be opened,
but the XFldDesktop class replacement would not be enabled
at all&per. Fixed; all XWorkplace features work in that
case too&per. 
.br

Programs&colon. Object data was never saved if the program
object had no program data, causing the "---" separators

New features&colon. 
:ul compact.:li.
Common&colon. Instead of adding the "Object" page, XWorkplace
now completely replaces the "Icon" page in every settings
notebook&per. 
.br
:li.
Common&colon. Added "Replace file dialog" feature&per.
This only replaces file dialogs within the WPS, not
globally on the system&per. If enabled, XWorkplace code
will use a replacement file dialog with full WPS support
instead of the dull default OS/2 file dialog&per. Try
the "Browse" button on the new "Icon" page&per. 
.br
:li.
Folders&colon. Added new :link reftype=hd res=10049."turbo folders":elink. feature&per.

.br
:li.
Folders&colon. Finally documented that setup string
objects can be put into the XWorkplace Configuration
Folder as well to have the setup string invoked on the
folder whose context menu was selected&per. This feature
has been active for a while, but I forgot to document
it&per. 
.br
:li.
Folder content menus&colon. The folder's "Include" criteria
are finally fully respected so that objects which do
not match those criteria do not appear in the folder
content menus either&per. 
.br
:li.
File types&colon. Added icon display to "File types"
page in "Workplace Shell"&per. Also added "Properties"
and "Open folder" items to association context menu&per.

.br
:li.
Programs&colon. If extended associations are enabled,
all program files will now be started by XWorkplace,
circumventing any WPS code around WinStartApp&per. As
a side effect, this will give you more detailed error
messages if the program could not be started&per. 
.br
:li.
Trash can&colon. Added EMPTYTRASH=IMMEDIATE setup string&per.

.br
:li.
XCenter&colon. "Add widget" menu is now sorted alphabetically&per.
This was confusing&per. 
.br

XCenter&colon. Pulse widget now supports more than one
CPU on SMP systems, thanks to Bart van Leeuwen&per.
As a result the display is painting lines instead of
filled areas now&per.

XCenter&colon. Added "Properties" dialog to "Pulse"
widget to allow color configuration, finally&per.

the focus can now start shutdown&per. 
.br

Netscape DDE&colon. Added more command line options
for specifying the DDE server name and the startup directory,
which can make NetscDDE work with Mozilla too&per. Also
removed the dull dialog explaining the command line
options and added a proper help panel (shows up if you
double-click on NETSCDDE&per.EXE only)&per. 
.br
:li.
xfix&colon. Added object IDs display and deletion&per.

Miscellaneous changes&colon.

Common&colon. Moved more pages from the INF to the HLP
file, such as :link reftype=hd res=10146.setup strings:elink.&per. In addition, WPProgram
setup strings are now documented also&per. 
.br
:li.
Common&colon. Reworked many dialogs and settings pages
to use my dialog formatter now&per. This makes changes
much easier and saves everyone from using the stupid
DLGEDIT any more (for those dialogs at least)&per. 
.br
:li.
Common&colon. Rework of the query-setup-string interfaces
to be less CPU-intensive&per. Also got rid of the danger
of synchronization problems between the two calls to
xwpQuerySetup that were always required&per. 
.br
:li.
Common&colon. Rewrote TMF loader to be much faster now&per.
XWorkplace now keeps its TMF file open all the time
and thus doesn't have to rebuild the strings buffer
for every message that is needed&per. 
.br
:li.
Common&colon. Rewrote Henk Kelder's WPS handles engine
to be much faster now&per. 
.br
:li.
Common&colon. Did lots of page tuning, both for frequently
used code and for the XWorkplace private heap&per. This
might result in speedups for certain time-critical places
such as folder populate and extended associations&per.

.br
:li.
Common&colon. Rewrote XWorkplace log file routines to
use DosWrite directly since the buffered fprintf() calls
sometimes didn't end up in the log at all (especially
on crashes)&per. 
.br
:li.
Common&colon. Per popular request, finally gave the
status dialogs the usual thick dialog borders&per. 
.br
:li.
Common&colon. Per popular request, reworked folder content
menu painting to always use at least the height of the
system mini icon size to avoid overlapping icons&per.

.br

Folders&colon. A private PMSHELL send-msg hook was registered
on WPS startup but never released even though it was
only used for the first folder that was ever opened&per.

open&per.

Archiving&colon. Changed the settings format for the
WPS extended archiving&per. Please reconfigure&per.

XCenter&colon. Tray icon is now displayed vertically
to use up less space&per. 
.br

XCenter&colon. Added error logging around DosFreeModule
for widget DLLs; this might result in log entries for
some older widget DLLs which fail to unload themselves&per.
The most probable cause for this is that the DLL registered
an exit list entry which causes DosFreeModule to fail
always&per.

.br
:li.
Common&colon. Removed all remaining must-complete sections
in the code which sometimes prevented PMSHELL from exiting
on kill or crashes&per. 
.br
:li.
Common&colon. Fixed a build problem which caused XWP
to fail on some Warp 3 systems since some of the Warp
4 SOM imports cannot be resolved there&per. 
.br
:li.
Common&colon. Paul Ratcliffe fixed a couple of cosmetic
things with the exception trap logs&per. 
.br
:li.
Common&colon. Fixed a bunch of wrong default template
settings for the XWP classes&per. 
.br
:li.
Common&colon. Fixed wrong owner windows for dialogs
created by the new dialog formatter, which, among other
things, affected the XWorkplace message boxes&per. Fixed
many misaligments and other cosmetic issues too&per.

.br
:li.
Common&colon. Paul Ratcliffe fixed bad AM/PM display
for 12&colon.00 noon in a library routine which, among
other things, affected the "Time" widget&per. 
.br
:li.
Common&colon. Added additional checks to an internal
populate routine which should now handle removeable
drives correctly&per. This should fix the problems with
folder content menus that removeable media changes weren't
picked up&per. 
.br
:li.
Startup&colon. Fixed endlessly looping startup folders&per.

.br
:li.
Icon replacemements&colon. While working on the program
icons replacement, I pretty much had to rewrite most
of the icon handling code in the WPS altogether&per.
As a side effect, I believe the problems with disappearing
icons and icons changing during refresh are now fixed
for good&per. 
.br
:li.
Object Details dialog&colon. Fixed crash if "No" was
selected in the confirmation dialog after changing the
object ID&per. 
.br
:li.
Programs&colon. Added more error checking to progOpenProgram&per.
Fixed more problems with programs not being started
from WPS thread 1, which can cause system hangs&per.
Also fixed problem that executable would not start if
it was not fully qualified in the program settings object,
but on the PATH only&per. 
.br
:li.
Disks&colon. Added more "drive ready" checks to context
menus and settings view to avoid some more "drive not
ready" popups&per. Note that context menus still show
"drive not ready" since that problem is in a WPS routine
I can't easily replace&per. 
.br
:li.
Folders&colon. MENUBAR setup string had a wrong default
value on Warp 4 and above&per. 
.br
:li.
Folders&colon. If the default folder view was set to
something other than "inherit" in "Workplace Shell",
changes in a folder's default view via the "Menu" page
(or the context menu item) were never picked up until
a Desktop restart&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Folders&colon. Replacement refresh code never picked
up RCNF_CHANGED notifications (which are quite rare
though)&per. Fixed, as well as some other missing notifications&per.

.br
:li.
Folders&colon. Added exception handling to an internal
populate helper which tended to crash on certain WPS
networking classes at times&per. 
.br
:li.
Extended associations&colon. If a data file had a type
set (either explicitly or automatically) but no associations
existed for that type, the "Open" submenu was empty&per.
Fixed; this now adds the associations for "Plain text"
to those objects too&per. 
.br
:li.
Status bars&colon. For remote disk objects (WPSharedDir),
the status bars kept querying drive A&colon. for the
free space, which was kind of annoying&per. The reason
was that WPShared&colon.&colon.wpQueryLogicalDrive returns
1 always for some reason only IBM can explain&per. Added
a special case check in a couple of places&per. 
.br
:li.
Status bars&colon. Fixed bad check for tree views which
sometimes failed to update themselves&per. 
.br
:li.
Status bars&colon. Fixed a bad exception handler cleanup&per.

.br
:li.
XCenter&colon. Removed all the special window actication
handling for now&per. Besides, the XCenter frame is
no longer a PM WC_FRAME instance&per. Hopefully this
doesn't break anything else but fixes the stupid Mozilla
problems many people were having&per. 
.br
:li.
XCenter&colon. Fixed the 100% CPU load problem when
mouse was over XCenter while a settings dialog was showing&per.

.br
:li.
XCenter&colon. Battery widget didn't repaint its background
properly when the power icon was changed&per. Fixed&per.

.br
:li.
XCenter&colon. Fixed some bad clipping with object buttons&per.

.br
:li.
XCenter&colon. Source emphasis for menus wasn't always
removed from client&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
XCenter&colon. Fixed crashes with objects from other
processes being dragged over XCenter&per. 
.br
:li.
File operations&colon. Mostly rewrote the "Replace File
Exists" dialog to finally handle the "Create another"
and "Create from template" conditions correctly&per.
Besides, all the special case checks for FAT drives
were removed because the WPS handles all this correctly
already&per. 
.br
:li.
File operations&colon. Replacement delete never respected
the "Confirm folder deletion" setting from the "Confirmations"
page&per. Fixed; if this is enabled, you now get an
extra prompt before XWorkplace kills a folder&per. 
.br
:li.
Trash can&colon. Fixed wrong error message if "delete
to trash" was still enabled internally but the trash
can had disappeared for some reason&per. XWP is now
offering to recreate the trash can instead&per. 
.br
:li.
Trash can&colon. Fixed problems with UNC files&per.

.br
:li.
Trash can&colon. Dropping objects on the shredder would
move them into the trash can instead&per. Fixed; they
are now properly nuked&per. 
.br
:li.
Trash can / true delete&colon. Paul Ratcliffe fixed
a bunch of potential traps with NULL object titles&per.

.br
:li.
Trash can&colon. Disabled the stupid "File exists" dialog
that popped up if some other object with the same title
already existed in the same hidden trash directory&per.
Note that this will only work if you have "Replace file
exists" enabled, unfortunately&per. 
.br
:li.
Object hotkeys&colon. It was impossible to set a hotkey
into the "Hotkey" entry field that was already occupied&per.
Even worse, if the object had been lost, this kept the
entry field from working at all&per. Fixed; note that
this implies that you can now use the same hotkey for
several objects at once&per. 
.br
:li.
XPager&colon. XCenters are now sticky always and do
not have to be added manually to the "Stickies" list
any more&per. 
.br
:li.
XPager&colon. System window list would sometimes be
moved off to another screen and then be hard to see&per.
Made window list sticky always now&per. 
.br
:li.
XPager&colon. Repaint broke after XPager was disabled
and then re-opened&per. Fixed by Paul Ratcliffe&per.

.br
:li.
Hook&colon. Object hotkeys stopped working after screen
lockup, unless XPager was enabled&per. Fixed&per. Also
fixed the problem that it was possible to use hotkeys
before the Desktop was ready and during shutdown&per.

.br
:li.
Hook&colon. Now disabling sliding focus while "move
ptr to default button" is in progress&per. 
.br
:li.
XShutdown&colon. Paul Ratcliffe fixed bug trying to
close the first switch list item twice&per. 
.br
:li.
XShutdown&colon. I believe I have traced down and fixed
the problems with XShutdown and the "Desktop not found"
problem if XWorkplace is installed on multiple OS/2
partitions&per. The problem was quite deep in the WPS
internals and actually a WPS bug that was exposed by
the XWorkplace "save objects" function&per. For some
reason, the WPS kept deleting the <WP_DESKTOP>
object ID (and other object IDs) if they didn't match
the data in the current INI file, which of course they
don't if the object ID is from another WPS&per. Fixed
that; the object's instance data is now hacked to keep
the old object ID&per. 
.br
:li.
XShutdown&colon. Fixed hang on "Releasing filesystems"
on some systems, hopefully&per. I can't really assure
this since the bug never occured on my system, but XWorkplace
attempted to load one string resource after DosShutdown,
which really isn't a good idea&per.&per.&per. fixed
that&per. 
.br
:li.
Treesize&colon. Fixed a couple of long-standing cosmetic
problems&per. Added a decent help panel&per.

notebook&per.

:li.
Mouse&colon. Martin Lafaix added a couple of settings
to the "Auto-hide mouse" feature and the general "Auto-move

dialog&per. 
.br
:li.
XCenter&colon. Optimized internal timers, which now

precise now&per. Thanks Martin Lafaix for the oriental
meditation hints&per.

XCenter&colon. Added more function imports to widget
DLLs to reduce their sizes&per.

Bugfixes&colon.

Fixed by Paul Ratcliffe&per. 
.br
:li.
XFolder&colon. Folder hotkeys for sort and arrange sorted
the desktop even if the respective menu items were disabled

to avoid accidentally sorting or arranging the desktop&per.

.br
:li.
XFolder&colon. Fixed a number of problems with "Create
another" in tree views, most notably that the new object
wouldn't appear unless the tree view had SHOWALLINTREEVIEW
set&per.

TCP/IP data, fixed&per.

"Keyboard" object&colon. "Hotkeys" page never used 8&per.Helv
font if enabled&per. Fixed by Paul Ratcliffe&per. 
.br

Status bars&colon. "Undo" on status bars page 2 in "Workplace
Shell" didn't undo everything&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Hook&colon. This allowed many things during lockup that
weren't supposed to happen, such as opening hot corner
objects&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
XPager&colon. I added a mutex around a global hook flag
which is used by XPager to avoid recursing into the
hook&per. It looks like this has improved the XPager
hangs that occured sporadically when many windows were
opened and closed&per. I am not sure yet if this completely
fixed the problem&per.

.br
:li.
General&colon. Did quite a major overhaul of the documentation&per.
Much information was moved from the User Guide to the
various help pages that appear if you press "Help" in
an object settings notebook&per. I find this more helpful
because then the help is in the context of what you're
doing&per. Also added more general explanations of some
OS/2 and WPS concepts to the help file&per.

Removed the temporary archive marker file that was previously

double-clicks if an audio CD was inserted in a CD-ROM
drive&per. 
.br

General&colon. Replaced internal binary tree implementation
with a new one&per. The old one proved to balance wrongly

Folder auto-refresh&colon. reworked quite a bit, this

After closing a subdialog of a notebook page, the WPS

Trash can kept crashing the WPS in some background thread
a few seconds after the last trash object was destroyed&per.
This happened because the WPS unloaded the XWPTrashObject

Trash objects had "Create another" menu item, which

I've finally found the time to rework all the functions

a number of internal functions significantly&per. 
.br
:li.
The code for building folder context menus from the
Configuration Folder contents has been mostly rewritten&per.
This now uses less memory and implements a cache for
the objects in the contents folder so that they need
not be rebuilt every time a context menu is opened,
but only if the &per.ICONPOS EAs changed&per. Lots of
new function in menus&per.c for this&per. 
.br

Restructured settings pages all over the place&per.

Raised default "variable menu item ID offset" to 700
for :link reftype=hd res=10035.Object Desktop compatibility:elink.&per.

Removed the "default class title" for the XFolder class&per.

Improved multithreading all over the place&per. Introduced

notebook&per.c)&per. 
.br
:li.
Some users reported that the Configuration Folder was
no longer found with certain configurations when it
was moved away from the location where the install program
creates it&per. Fixed; since the WPS method which has
been defined for this doesn't seem to be working with
all Warp versions and fixpak levels (esp&per. not on
Aurora), I have written my own (wpshQueryObjectFromID)&per.

.br

When folder auto-sort was off but status bars enabled,
folder contents would keep scrolling up when opened
in Icon view, adding ugly scroll bars to the folder
window even if not necessary&per. Fixed (now zeroing
SUBCLASSEDLISTITEM properly, cmnSubclassFolderFrame,

Folder content menus would sometimes crash with titles

Right-click on status bars opened the closed-view context

The "Select by name" dialog had problems finding files

The boot logo would remain on the screen forever if

bar information&per. Fixed, thanks to RÅdiger Ihle who

Error message 99 when opening a disk object had a "%1"
string in there&per. Fixed; this now displays the drive
letter&per.

The WPS class list produced an exception every time
a class was deregistered using the context menus&per.
Fixed; container record cores are now freed before the
corresponding data is freed&per.

Previous versions sometimes forgot to process the contents
of the XWorkplace startup folder upon first bootup&per.
This has been completely reworked, now using the XWorkplace
daemon (XWPDAEMON&per.EXE)&per. 
.br
:li.
XShutdown would crash when the INI file names were specified
in lower case in :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.CONFIG&per.SYS:font facename=default size=0x0.&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
XShutdown sent WM_CLOSE to some applications instead
of just WM_QUIT&per. For example, Program Commander
didn't like this too much&per. Fixed; all PM apps get
WM_QUIT now&per. 
.br
:li.
For some reason, XFldObject&colon.&colon.wpObjectReady
does not get called for WPFolder instances (at least
on my Warp 4 FP 10), so that the Worker thread was unable
to track awake folders&per.Fixed; we now override XFolder&colon.&colon.wpObjectReady
also&per. 
.br
:li.
Finally made the global and kernel settings thread-safe
in really all possible situations (hopefully)&per. This
fixes a number of problems with folder windows which
are not running on thread 1, which happens sometimes
(e&per.g&per. folders opened from REXX or TREESIZE&per.EXE)&per.

.br
:li.
Reworked exception handlers once again&per. This fixes
hangs in the Worker thread when PMSHELL&per.EXE got
killed or trapped somewhere, which used to require a
system reboot&per.

I have reorganized large portions of the XShutdown code,

Also changed the way status bars save whether the size
of a folder window has been increased already&per. This
is now stored together with the other folder pos data
in OS2&per.INI, "PM_Workplace&colon.FolderPos"&per.
The status bar keys end in "@XFSB"&per. This should
fix the problem that folder windows were frequently

.br
:li.
Fixed a few problems with the "File exists" dialog&colon.
1) XFolder's "does file exist" algorithm behaved differently
from the default WPS behavior when files were copied
from HPFS to FAT or from FAT to FAT and the long name
was different from the real name; 2) on FAT drives,
the proposed name were in 8+3 format, which is not very
useful; 3) the proposed names used to be based on the
existing real names, not file titles&per. 4) Also, "rename"
behaved funny on FAT drives sometimes&per. Ooouuuargh&per.
Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Folder views behaved really strange with some CD-ROM
directories, especially with the new Joliet support
of CDFS&per.IFS&per. I suspect this was due to some
of my DosDevIOCtl's, which I have removed now&per. 
.br
:li.
On some systems, opening folder content menus for removeable
drives hung the system when those drives were empty
(e&per.g&per. because no floppy disk was in the drive)&per.
Added drive checking for folder content menus&per. 
.br
:li.
In rare occasions, previous versions would mess up the
:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.CONFIG&per.SYS:font facename=default size=0x0. file by not setting the correct file
size after writing, which led to garbage characters
at the end of the file&per. Fixed, thanks to ARAKAWA,
Atshushi&per. 
.br

The Worker thread was frequently given "regular" priority,
which slowed down the other WPS threads&per. Fixed;
Worker thread priority is now properly set to "idle"&per.

SOUND&per.DLL was missing in the V0&per.83 distribution&per.

XFolder would sometimes fail to process its startup

In rare occasions, e&per.g&per. with ObjectREXX's WPS

A few cosmetic changes to the XFolder dialogs&per.

Bugfixes&colon. 
:ul compact.:li.
Removal of default menu items broke for data-file objects
in V0&per.81&per. Fixed (new wpFilterPopupMenu in xfdataf&per.*)&per.

.br
:li.
Changing file attributes from shadow context menus led
to crashes when several shadows were selected&per. Fixed
(mnuFileSystemSelectingMenuItem, menus&per.c)&per. 
.br
:li.
Copying file names didn't work right either if this
was selected from a context menu of several shadows&per.
Fixed (same place)&per. 
.br
:li.
Replacement "File conflict" dialog sometimes displayed
outdated file size/date/time information&per. Fixed
(wpConfirmObjectTitle, xfobj&per.c)&per. 
.br
:li.
With V0&per.82, XFolder forgot how to write :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.CONFIG&per.SYS:font facename=default size=0x0.
to disk&per. That rendered the whole "OS/2 Kernel" object
pretty useless&per. Fixed, sorry (fncbConfigItemChanged,
xfsys&per.c)&per. 
.br
:li.
SUPPRESSPOPUPS wasn't properly read from :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.CONFIG&per.SYS:font facename=default size=0x0.
("Errors" page)&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
The second "Screen" page which is inserted into the
"System" object for some video drivers did not appear
in "OS/2 Kernel", but somewhere in "Workplace Shell"&per.
Fixed (wpAddDMQSDisplayTypePage, xfsys&per.*)&per. 
.br
:li.
XShutdown sometimes reported a data size of 0 when saving
INI keys&per. This is now silently ignored, so that
those error messages shouldn't appear any longer&per.

.br
:li.
XShutdown got confused with programs which appeared
with a PROG_DEFAULT type in the tasklist&per. Fixed
(xsdBuildShutList, xfdesk&per.c)&per. 
.br
:li.
APM power-off entered a critical section after calling
the APM interface, which kept power-off from functioning&per.
Fixed (apm&per.c)&per. 
.br
:li.
Dialogs were resized very badly when video resolution
was changed&per. Fixed; I am now using my own routines
for storing/restoring window positions in winh&per.*&per.

.br
:li.
Treesize reportedly had trouble on very large hard drives&per.
I suspect this was due to my use of unsigned int variables,
which can only hold values up to some 4 billion (= 4
GB)&per. Fixed, I'm now always using double variables&per.

:eul.:hp2.
:p.
Version 0&per.82 beta (November 19, 1998):ehp2. This is a
:hp1.major:ehp1. rework&per. It might not look too different from
the previous version, but I've cleaned up a lot of things&per.

:p.
New features&colon. 
:ul compact.:li.
More Treesize settings&colon. size display format, low-priority
search&per. 
.br
:li.
XFolder :hp1.finally:ehp1. has OS/2 Warp 4 notebook buttons&per.
There's a new function winhAssertWarp4Notebook in /helpers/winh&per.c
which can do this with any notebook page without having
to change the dialog resources&per. Thanks, Martin Lafaix,
for the necessary information&per. 
.br
:li.
Thanks to ARAKAWA Atsushi, APM power-off now works&per.
(I hope&per. Again, I cannot test this&per.) 
.br
:li.
Added a few more WPS class descriptions&per. 
:eul.
:p.
Miscellaneous changes&colon. 
:ul compact.:li.
Removed the XFldFileSystem class because it wasn't doing
much anyway and caused installation failures on Warp
3 without fixpaks&per. Its functionality is now handled
by the XFolder and XFldDataFile classes directly&per.

.br
:li.
Removed the XFolder exit list because this seemed to
have caused some problems during Desktop restarts (xfdesk&per.c)&per.
Also changed the algorithm which determines whether
the startup folder should be processed (fnwpWorkerObject,
xfdesk&per.c)&per. 
.br
:li.
Completely reworked all the settings notebook page logic&per.
Almost all pages are now using much more lucid callbacks
from the new notebook&per.* files&per. This also ensures
proper updating of pages when other pages are currently
open too&per. 
.br
:li.
Completely reworked the SOM logic for the "WPS Classes"
page in "Workplace Shell"&per. Maybe this helps with
the problems previous versions had on some systems&per.
Also, this now even displays classes which do not appear
in the "official" WPS class list, because some internal
classes are loaded independently of that&per. Finally,
multiple class replacements are now properly displayed&per.
Found an interesting undocumented SOM method (see clsWpsClasses2Cnr
in classlist&per.c for details)&per. 
.br
:li.
Also added source emphasis to the "WPS Classes" container
when context menus are opened&per. Previous versions
had trouble keeping the selected classes apart&per.

.br
:li.
XFolder is now smart enough to write changes to :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.CONFIG&per.SYS:font facename=default size=0x0.
in lower case if the keyword which is replaced contains
lower-case characters too (fnwpConfigCommon, xfsys&per.c,
and str* helper functions in /helpers/dosh&per.*)&per.

.br
:li.
Fixed a coupla things with NLS DLL loading to make V0&per.82
work with V0&per.81 NLS DLLs (cmnQueryNLSModuleHandle,
common&per.c)&per. 
.br
:li.
XFolder can now write SUPPRESSPOPUPS=0 on "Errors" page
in "OS/2 Kernel"&per. This is a new setting since FP29
(fnwpConfigCommon, xfsys&per.c)&per. 
.br
:li.
Sped up confirmation dialog display (XFldObject&colon.&colon.wpConfirmObjectTitle,
xfobj&per.c)&per. 
.br
:li.
Treesize is now much faster collecting extended attributes
(up to 300%)&per. Also fixed some strange hangs/crashes
on some directories&per. 
:eul.
:p.
Bugfixes&colon. 
:ul compact.:li.
"Templates" checkbox had disappeared from several object
notebooks in V0&per.80 (removed various wpclsQueryStyle
method overrides)&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Previous versions tended to crash if folders were not
running on thread 1 of the WPS&per. This was especially
the case with folders created by various install programs
(StarOffice, IBM feature install)&per. Sorry, XFolder
status bars apparently weren't thread-safe&per. XFolder
now creates a new object window for each folder which
is opened (fnwpSupplObject, xfldr&per.c), so that status
bar manipulation always occurs on the thread in which
the folder is running&per. 
.br
:li.
First "Context menus" settings page had German buttons&per.
This was just an educational measure&per. ;-) Fixed&per.

.br
:li.
"Status bars" page 2 had "XFldDataFile" as the default
class selection, even though that class doesn't support
status bar codes&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Added more error checking to the "QuickOpen" and "Favorite
Folder" functions&per. Maybe this helps with those strange
exceptions on the first settings page for folders&per.

.br
:li.
XFolder now enforces minimum settings notebook sizes
when these are initially opened, because large pages
were truncated previously (new wpclsQuerySettingsPageSize
method overrides in xfdesk&per.* / xfsys&per.*)&per.

.br
:li.
Reworked the "folder content" menu display so that it
only uses regular icons now&per. Maybe this solves the
mysterious crashes with some video drivers&per. 
.br
:li.
Reworked several parts in menu handling because items
were inserted in the wrong places (menus&per.c)&per.
I also forgot to add the "folder view" items to Warp
4's menu bar too&per. And "Create another" was always
disabled, no matter if this was desired in the "Workplace
Shell" object&per. Finally, "Select by name" wouldn't
show up on Warp 3&per. All fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Also added more error checking when evaluating the config
folder&per. This should lead to less warning messages
if objects are deleted from there (menus&per.c)&per.

.br
:li.
Startup/QuickOpen status windows were not destroyed,
but only hidden when that action was finished&per. Fixed&per.

.br
:li.
INI file maintenance broke somewhere in V0&per.8x; this
is now done by the Worker thread (xfdesk&per.c)&per.
Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Saving INIs&colon. "Ignore" button should now work when
errors occur (/helpers/prfh&per.c)&per. 
.br
:li.
Fixed a few repaint problems with progress bars (/helpers/progbars&per.c)&per.

.br
:li.
Fixed a lot of bugs with the new system sounds&per.
For one, XFolder failed to install on systems where
MMPM/2 was not installed, because XFLDR&per.DLL was
linked against the MMPM/2 libraries, which then could
not be imported&per. So we have a new, second SOUND&per.DLL,
which does all the sound playing&per. If loading that
DLL fails, XFolder simply won't play sounds&per. See
the sound&per.* files for details&per. -- Second, XFolder
got really confused playing sounds when other applications
needed the audio device too&per. This is now solved;
XFolder checks for whether the device is available,
and if another application wants the device while XFolder
is playing, playing is stopped also&per. -- Third, System
sounds in V0&per.81 worked only if they had been disabled
and enabled again in the "Sound" object (cmnQuerySystemSound,
common&per.c)&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Couple of broken links in the German HLP file&per. Fixed&per.

.br
:li.
Install script crashed when invalid language code was
entered&per. Fixed&per. 
:eul.:hp2.
:p.
Version 0&per.81 beta (October 18, 1998):ehp2. Starting with
this version, the file and function of the error in
the source files is specified here too&per. For details
about the source code changes, refer to the "CHANGELOG&per.TXT"
file in the source distribution&per.

Treesize external program&per. Part of the default context

Due to popular request, :link reftype=hd res=10046."Snap to grid":elink. can now snap
the selected icons only&per. 
.br

The position of the startup folder status window is
finally saved and restored the next time&per. Sorry
this has taken so long&per. 
:eul.
:p.
Miscellaneous changes&colon. 
:ul compact.:li.
Gave up using SOM multiple inheritance, which seems
to have caused too much trouble&per. In detail, the
xfSelectingMenu and xf* methods for status bars have
been removed from XFldObject and subclasses&per. Status
bar single-object info is now handled in statbars&per.c
(new file) with _somIsA() calls instead&per. Not as
elegant, but might be a bit faster than SOM method resolution
too&per. 
.br
:li.
XFldProgram class removed&per. Its only purpose was
for status bars using SOM multiple inheritance&per.
Functionality is now handled by menus&per.c&per. 
.br
:li.
Removed extended Settings submenus&per. Caused too much
trouble&per. Instead, you may now set additional "Attributes"
and "Folder view" menu items in "Workplace Shell"&per.

.br
:li.
Improved animation code to avoid flickering&per. All
the common code for this is now in the new animate&per.*
files&per. 
.br
:li.
Added exception handling to "XFolder" notebook page
in folders&per. This seems to have broken on some systems&per.

.br
:li.
Made the file-system class replacements return the CLSSTYLE_NEVERTEMPLATE
from wpclsQueryStyle so that no additional templates
are produced in the Templates folder&per. 
.br
:li.
Reworked status bar code completely&per. Should be quite
a bit faster now; however, each code is only translated
_once_ now&per. 
.br
:li.
Rearranged the pages in the "OS/2 Kernel" and "Workplace
Shell" objects&per. Also changed the replaced SOM methods
(xfsys&per.*)&per. "OS/2 Kernel" should now contain
all the settings which require a reboot to take effect&per.
I guess this is a more logical rule&per. 
.br
:li.
Removed those darn xfclsQueryModule methods which were
used to query the module handle of xfldr&per.dll&per.
This might have caused installation failures on some
systems&per. There is a new DLL init function in module&per.c
now which is a lot faster and causes less problems&per.

.br
:li.
As a nice side-effect to this, XFolder does not need
any INI entries any more to run properly&per. If you
delete the whole "XFolder" INI thing, XFolder will re-initialize
itself&per. 
.br
:li.
Install script set up config folder to open in Tree
view per default&per. Unfortunately this caused &per.LONGNAME
EAs not to be rewritten when the main config folder
was altered&per. Fixed, this now uses non-flowed icon
view&per. 
:eul.
:p.
Bugfixes&colon. 
:ul compact.:li.
"HPFS" page wrote "LAZY&colon.1" instead of "/LAZY&colon.1"
to :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.CONFIG&per.SYS:font facename=default size=0x0.&per. Fixed (xfsys&per.c, fnwpConfigCommon)&per.

.br
:li.
"HPFS" page could read a few IFS parameters in upper
case only&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
"Memory" page wrote "HPFS" settings too&per. Forgot
a "break" in fnwpConfigCommon, xfsys&per.c&per. 
.br
:li.
"Errors" page wrote "REIPL=YES" instead of "REIPL=ON"&per.
Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
"Object Internals" page displayed object handles only
25% of the time, depending on how large your object
repository was&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Install script failed to create "Workplace Shell" and
"OS/2 Kernel" objects if the XFolder Configuration folder
already existed&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Creating objects from context menus caused non-reproduceable
system hangs from time to time (really bad ones where
even C-A-D faild)&per. Added more error checking (cmnCreateFromTemplate,
common&per.c; this used to be XFldObject&colon.&colon.xfCreateFromTemplate)
and rewrote large parts of that routine to use container
messaging now instead of WPS methods&per. Seems to always
work now&per. 
.br
:li.
Reworked "Snap to grid" also so that it now properly
uses container messages (xfSnapToGrid, xfldr&per.c)&per.

.br
:li.
Status bars now check for removeable drives before querying
disk information&per. Those ugly "drive not ready" popups
should now be gone&per. 
.br
:li.
Status bars reported garbage if a filename to be displayed
contained a '$' character also&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
"Folder hotkeys" page listed an "Insert" item, which
should have been called "Paste"&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Opening large folder content menus (which were repositioned
on the screen) would sometimes cause all menus not to
react to mouse clicks any more&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Fixed a memory leak in bitmap handling&per. I was using
IBM sample code again&per.&per.&per. 
.br
:li.
XFolder would sometimes attempt to play system sounds
even though no system sounds were enabled&per. Fixed&per.

.br
:li.
XFolder sometimes conflicted with the WPS container
manipulation when extended sorting was on&per. Icons
could still be moved within a folder even though "Always
sort" was on&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Install script failed to create the new "Workplace Shell"
and "OS/2 Kernel" objects when the config folder already
existed&per. Fixed&per. There are now two additional
scripts in \INSTALL&per. 
:eul.:hp2.
:p.
Version 0&per.80 (September 29, 1998):ehp2. XFolder's licence
agreement has changed&per. I am now releasing the source
code and have placed XFolder under the GNU Public Licence&per.
See :link reftype=hd res=10001."Licence":elink. for details&per. 
:p.
New features&colon. 
:ul compact.:li.
XFolder can now replace some WPS confirmation dialogs&per.

.br
:li.
Under OS/2 Warp 4, XFolder finally manages to modify
folder menu bars also according to the context menu
settings&per. 
.br
:li.
The :link reftype=hd res=10069.XFolder Startup:elink. folder now has a new menu item in
its context menu&colon. "Start folder content" allows
you to start all the objects in it even after the WPS
is up&per. 
.br
:li.
:link reftype=hd res=10052."QuickOpen":elink. feature for folders&per. 
.br
:li.
The "System" object is now split into two new "OS/2
Kernel" and "Workplace Shell" objects&per. Refer to
:link reftype=hd res=10082.this page:elink. for more&per. 
.br
:li.
New settings pages therein to change those risky and
obscure :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.CONFIG&per.SYS:font facename=default size=0x0. settings&per. Included :link reftype=hd res=10082.plenty
of information:elink. for this&per. 
.br
:li.
New "WPS classes" page for manipulating the WPS class
list&per. 
.br
:li.
Every object now has an "Internals" page in its settings
notebook&per. Here you can look at lots of information
which you can't see otherwise and even change the object's
ID&per. 
.br
:li.
:link reftype=hd res=10047."Copy filename":elink. finally works properly with multiple
selections in a folder&per. Multiple filenames are then
separated by spaces&per. Also introduced new :link reftype=hd res=10053.folder
hotkeys:elink. for copying the filename (without path&colon.
Ctrl+Insert per default)&per. 
.br
:li.
Status bars now support different information in single-object
mode depending on the class to which the selected object
belongs&per. To implement this, I had to introduce even
more WPS class replacements&per. 8-) Moreover, the "$x"
key for status bars now supports formatting text from
the right or as a percentage of the status bar width&per.
Also introduced a few more keys&per. See :link reftype=hd res=10057."Configuring
status bars":elink. for details&per. 
.br
:li.
Status bars now also work for tree views, if you enable
this in the Global Settings&per. 
.br
:li.
Status bars now display the folder's context menu when
you right-click on them&per. 
.br
:li.
Added a new status bar display style ("Warp 3 sunken")&per.

.br
:li.
XShutdown can now display a little animation&per. 
.br
:li.
"Restart Desktop" now has a setting for whether the
startup folder should be processed after the restart&per.

.br
:li.
I have provided a source-code plug-in interface for
people who are willing and able to teach XShutdown how
to do an APM V1&per.2 power-off&per. My BIOS does not
support this, so I cannot do this myself&per. Hopefully
somebody will succeed&per.

XShutdown :link reftype=hd res=10070.command-line interface&per.:elink. 
:eul.
:p.
Miscellaneous changes&colon. 
:ul compact.:li.
Rearranged the "Context menu" settings pages more logically
(I hope)&per. 
.br
:li.
Finally included proper (and updated) NetscDDE documentation
in a separate INF file&per. NETSCDDE&per.TXT is gone&per.

.br
:li.
Beautified XFolder message boxes a little&per. These
now accept fonts from the font palettes, and these are
stored&per. So at least the XFolder message boxes don't
use that ugly "System Proportional" font any more&per.

.br
:li.
When "Always maintain sort order" is enabled globally,
XFolder now wants a confirmation for whether the Desktop
should also be sorted&per. This will prevent you from
accidentally sorting the Desktop&per. 
.br
:li.
"Show icons" for the "Folder content" functions is now
disabled per default&per. Some video drivers apparently
had serious trouble with this (I was told this for the
Matrox Millenium; my ELSA card works fine though)&per.

.br
:li.
"Folder content" menus are now repositioned on the screen
when they're very large to avoid having them displayed
outside the visible screen area&per. 
.br
:li.
Completely reworked the config folder menu item handling&per.
Previous versions had problems when the &per.LONGNAME
EAs contained different information than the actual
folder content in the INI files&per. These two sources
are now compared and balanced&per. As a side effect,
processing these menu items also now consumes less memory
and is faster&per. 
.br
:li.
Also reworked the folder content menu item handling&per.
Previous versions sent far too many PM messages to the
menu window, which cost a lot of time, especially for
folders on FAT drives, which are not sorted by default&per.
Sorting is now done in memory before inserting the menu
items using a QuickSort algorithm&per. Even on huge
directories, this never takes longer than half a second&per.
I can't do much about the slow icon retrieval though,
that's WPS-internal&per. 
.br
:li.
Since I was given a VisualAge C++ compiler by Mark Mellin
(thanks again), this version is now using a better compiler&per.
Since VisualAge C++ does contain pretty good programming
information, I've spent a couple of days on compiler
options and code optimizing, and I hope that this has
resulted in speedier code&per. 
.br
:li.
Better memory handling altogher&per. XFolder now returns
unused memory to the operating system from time to time&per.

.br
:li.
Replaced my own string handling routines with those
from an old programmers CD-ROM which are way faster&per.

.br
:li.
Converted a few SOM instance methods into regular C
functions&per. This should speed up XFolder a little
bit&per. 
.br
:li.
XShutdown now always closes the Desktop and WarpCenter
windows last&per. This will prevent the situation that
you'll be unable to use your system after Shutdown has
been cancelled because the Desktop has already been
closed&per. 
:eul.
:p.
Yet more bugfixes in this version&colon. 
:ul compact.:li.
Moving Object Desktop's TSEnhFolder in the install script
didn't work&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Win95 keys are finally working&per. This time I'm sure
;-) because Glauco Ippolitoni, Italy, sent me a keyboard
with those keys&per. Thanks again&per. 
.br
:li.
Previous versions crashed building the context menus
if the config folder contained a broken shadow&per.
Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
The same applied to folder content menus if broken shadows
were found&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Included much more error checking for those folder content
menus&per. Maybe this solves some of the video driver
problems mentioned above&per. 
.br
:li.
Setting extended sort options from context menus didn't
work for open drive (root folder) views&per. Fixed&per.
But to do this, I had to introduce two new WPS methods&per.
&colon.-( 
.br
:li.
Previous versions kept causing exceptions internally
when objects were being deleted&per. For some reason
which I still don't understand, XFolder's wpUnInitData
method kept getting called twice by the WPS, which really
doesn't make sense&per. Although this error was handled
by the internal WPS exception handler, this slowed down
the deleting process immensely&per. Fixed&per. (But
I'm still amazed&per.) 
.br
:li.
XFolder failed to release an instance mutex semaphore
when a folder was put back to sleep&per. Ooops&per.
Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Found a memory leak in the code doing the "program object
tricks" in the config folder&per. This must have been
in there since XFolder 0&per.3x&per. To my excuse, I
took exactly the example code from the wpQueryProgDetails
Toolkit docs, which also forgets to release the allocated
memory&per. ;-) Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
The values for the "Snap to grid" feature were not dynamically
updated when changed in the Global Settings&per. This
must have broken in V0&per.70&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
"Select by name" appeared in the wrong places when the
"Display" menu was removed&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Folder status bars messed up window painting when the
window was resized so that the status bar overlapped
the title bar, especially when "roll-up" features by,
say, X&per.it were used&per. A simple WS_CLIPSIBLINGS
fixed this&per. 
.br
:li.
"Refresh now" did not refresh status bar data&per. Fixed&per.

.br
:li.
Included more consistency checking for the Worker thread
when it remembers awake objects&per. Previous versions
had a tendency to crash in the Worker thread from time
to time when the Worker thread tried to store an awake
object which wasn't really awake any more&per. (This
occured mainly when deleting many objects in subfolders&per.
For all programmers&colon. contrary to what IBM says
in the SOM documentation, somIsObj obviously is NOT
crash-safe&per.) Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Previous versions opened the objects in the startup
/ shutdown folders from the (background) Worker thread,
which led to sporadic, unpredictable crashes&per. Besides
the WarpCenter strongly disliked not being started from
the Workplace thread&per. These objects are now opened
from the main WPS (Workplace) thread&per. 
.br
:li.
XFolder Startup folder was not processed during first
startup after installation&per. (But only this one time&per.)
Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
The "XFolder Internals" settings page crashed when the
filenames of the NLS DLLs were in capital letters (esp&per.
on FAT drives)&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
XShutdown hung when it tried to close a PM program which
was hung also&per. (Especially with Netscape&per.&per.&per.)
The "Skip" button wouldn't help anymore then, because
it just didn't react&per. Fixed&colon. Messages are
now posted, not sent, to PM windows&per. 
.br
:li.
Contrary to what the "Auto-close non-PM sessions" window
said, no Ctrl+C signal was sent to a non-PM session,
but Ctrl+Break instead&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
The XShutdown Update thread got lost sometimes when
shutdown was initialized&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Completely reworked the XShutdown routines dealing with
saving the INI files&per. Included a lot more error
checking, and the error messages are now more meaningful&per.
I hope that the errors many users have reported have
now disappeared, and if not, they won't take the whole
system down or even crash your WPS&per. 
.br
:li.
Fixed a bug which caused saving the INI files to crash
when they were specified in lower case in :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.CONFIG&per.SYS:font facename=default size=0x0.&per.

.br
:li.
"Paste" and "View" were still called "Insert" and "Display"
in some places&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
A few links in the INF files were messed up&per. Fixed&per.

:eul.:hp2.
:p.
Version 0&per.71 (July 2, 1998):ehp2. Only bugfixes in this
version&per. 
:p.
Bugfixes&colon. 
:ul compact.:li.
Status bars were not updated any more when objects were
deleted from an open folder&per. For some reason, the
WPS considers a folder "not populated" any more when
it deletes an object from it, and XFolder therefore
stopped updating status bars&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
V0&per.70 removed the whole "Sort" menu and re-inserted
items with different menu ids even for default WPS sort
menus, which caused other WPS enhancers (X&per.it) to
fail when they were trying to sort folders&per. XFolder
now only ADDS items and leaves the other items alone&per.

.br
:li.
Use of $S keys in "single-object mode" caused other
object information to be always related to last object
in folder (e&per.g&per. "$C objects, $SK KB (selected&colon.
$t [$w] $D $T)")&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Forgot to document a few status bar mnemonics in the
online help&per. 
.br
:li.
Win95 keys were recognized as hotkeys in the Global
Settings, but not saved&per. Again, I don't have those
keys, but I've fixed something&per. Let's see if it
works&per. 
.br
:li.
XFolder sometimes crashed at bootup when no config folder
was present&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Since the WPS crashes big time when menu IDs > 0x8000
are used, XFolder now checks for this (folder content
menus) and aborts processing then&per. 
.br
:li.
The Warp 4 "Insert" menu item is actually called "Paste"&per.
Sorry, I have a German OS/2&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
"Restart Desktop" now saves and closes all open WPS
windows, including the Desktop, regardless of whether
"Close all open windows" was checked&per. Since all
WPS windows will be closed anyway when the WPS terminates,
I might just as well do it myself&per. This has the
advantage that icon positions are finally saved for
the Desktop too&per. 
.br
:li.
"Restart Desktop" doesn't use WPSRESET&per.EXE any more&per.
A simple DosExit(EXIT_PROCESS, 0) does it too&per. If
I had figured this out earlier, this could have saved
me a couple of days of trial and error&per. ;-) 
.br
:li.
Moved a lot of code from the subclassed frame window
procedure to a new, separate object window, which is
also running in the PMSHELL Workplace thread&per. This
might increase compatibility with other WPS software
which also does subclassing&per. 
.br
:li.
Just a cosmetic correction&colon. the "reboot" drop-down
list box in the XShutdown confirmation dialog was disabled
illogically&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Not really a bugfix, but XFolder now creates a shutdown
log in the root directory of your boot drive ("xshutdwn&per.log")&per.
Some people still have trouble getting XShutdown to
work, and this might help tracking these problems down&per.

.br
:li.
Now that I had the shutdown log, I was able to track
down the mysterious problems WRT closing VIO sessions,
and I found a major bug which caused XShutdown to sometimes
close a different session than the one that was intended&per.
Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
I also rearranged the order of commands that were executed
while saving the INIs during shutdown&per. Maybe this
helps those people who (mysteriously) still can't get
those functions to work&per.&per.&per. otherwise, check
the shutdown log&per. 
.br
:li.
Rearranged the order of classes in the install script&per.
Some systems seemed to have problems with the previous
order&per. 
:eul.:hp2.

Version 0&per.70 (beta) (June 26, 1998):ehp2. Hoo-yah, yet

Rearranged Global Settings more orderly&per.

Cleaned up internal menu handling routines big time
in order to make the new folder content features work&per.
As a result, the 50-objects limit of previous versions
has been removed&per. 
.br
:li.
Default menu items are now removed if a respective checkbox
is :hp1.un:ehp1.checked; this seems more consistent to me&per.

.br
:li.
"Help" submenu may now also be removed&per. 
.br
:li.
XFolder setup strings introduced for use with REXX&per.

.br

.br
:li.
Support for Win95 keyboards (folder hotkeys)&per.

:li.
Beautified dialogs a little&per. ;-) 
.br

.br

.br
:li.
User-configurable reboot actions&per. 
.br

"Shutdown" and "Restart Desktop" items in Desktop context
menu now contain "&per.&per.&per." only when confirmations

:eul.

Still more bugfixes&colon. 
:ul compact.:li.
Improved exception handling again&per. 
.br
:li.
XFolder refused to create objects altogether when "Open
settings after creating from templates" in the Global
Settings was disabled&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
XFolder crashed when objects were added to the config
folder while these were closed&per. This resulted in
folder context menus not appearing at all&per. Fixed&per.

.br
:li.
XFolder got confused on the "XFolder" page in folder
settings notebooks enabling the checkboxes properly&per.
Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
For mysterious reasons, XFolder would crash on some
systems after dropping something on the root folder
of the boot drive&per. Fixed (I hope)&per. 
.br
:li.
Disabling folder hotkeys would disable all folder subclassing,
including "Auto-scroll tree views"&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
The Warp 4 "View" menu was dubbed "Display" in XFolder
dialogs and help files&per. Sorry, I don't have an English
Warp 4&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
XShutdown failed to save INIs when the existing OS2*&per.INI
files had the HRS attributes on ("An error occured saving
the INI files&colon. 5")&per. This should be fixed now&per.

.br
:li.
XShutdown would sometimes hang after closing all windows,
waiting forever for the Update thread to terminate&per.
Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
XShutdown would sometimes fail to begin shutdown, although
the status window was already displayed, because it
was resetting some event semaphore which was already
posted&per. Fixed&per. 
:eul.:hp2.
:p.
Version 0&per.61 (beta) (May 10, 1998):ehp2. This is mainly
a maintenance release to fix the bugs detected in the
last version&per. 
:p.
Some new features anyway&colon. 
:ul compact.:li.
XFolder now populates the Config folders in the background
after Desktop startup, so you don't have to wait forever
on the first right mouse-click&per. 
.br
:li.
New "Auto-close non-PM sessions" setting for XShutdown&per.
By popular demand&per. ;-) 
.br
:li.
New NETSCDDE included&per. See NETSCDDE&per.TXT for
details&per. 
.br
:li.
Changed the default folder hotkey configuration for
more :link reftype=hd res=10053.default hotkeys:elink.&per. 
.br
:li.
Documented :link reftype=hd res=10128.XShutdown internals:elink.&per. 
:eul.
:p.
Even more bugfixes&colon. 
:ul compact.:li.
XShutdown failed to save data of folders which were
awake (i&per.e&per. stored somewhere in the WPS process),
although they were not visibly open&per. This applied
especially to the XFolder Config Folder&per. This is
now fixed; all awake folders are saved too&per. 
.br
:li.
XShutdown sometimes failed to save INI files properly&per.
Error checking is now implemented&per. 
.br
:li.
XShutdown sometimes failed to close non-PM sessions&per.
At least DOS/Win-OS/2 sessions had to be closed manually&per.
This was due to a bug (feature?!?) in WinQueryWindowProcess,
which does not return the process and session IDs of
DOS machines, but those of the first PMSHELL instance&per.
I don't know what this should be good for&per.&per.&per.
anyway, it's fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
XShutdown threads had wrong priority settings, so they
would wait forever when a session had higher priority
settings than them&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
XShutdown also sometimes got confused with its thread
management and would start the same thread twice&per.
Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Fixed some minor annoyments in the install script&per.

.br
:li.
Somehow languages got messed up after installation;
the dialogs were in German, the help files in English&per.
Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
"Auto-scroll Tree views" did not always realize when
the WPS was done populating a folder&per. Fixed&per.

.br
:li.
Exception management enhanced&per. Crashes in XFolder
will now not always take the whole WPS down&per. Changed
location of trap log file to the OS/2 boot drive; if
you hear funny sounds, look for "?&colon.\XFLDTRAP&per.LOG"
with "?" being your boot drive&per. 
.br
:li.
Individual folder settings were sometimes set to "disabled"
per default&per. This does of course not make sense&per.
Fixed&per. 
:eul.:hp2.
:p.
Version 0&per.60 (beta) (May 4, 1998):ehp2. I know it's been
a while since the last release, but to make up for it,
this is a mega-version&per.&per.&per. 
:p.
New features / Changes&colon. 
:ul compact.:li.
XFolder is finally able to :link reftype=hd res=10043.order context menu items:elink.
according to the order which is seen in Name or Details
views of the corresponding config folder&per. This was
a real hassle&per.&per.&per. 
.br
:li.
"Auto-scroll tree views" feature&per. 
.br
:li.
XFolder is now fully multi-threaded ("XFolder Worker
thread")&per. 
.br
:li.
:link reftype=hd res=10068.Extended Shutdown:elink. and "Restart Desktop" features and
new settings page for Desktop&per. 
.br
:li.
:link reftype=hd res=10047."Copy filename":elink. feature&per. 
.br
:li.
Moved the recreation of the default Config folder into
the XFolder code; this is not any more done by the install
script&per. This way, if the config folder gets lost,
you may recreate your default config folder automatically&per.

.br
:li.
XFolder is finally able to process hotkeys for the Desktop
and drive (disk) objects also&per. 
.br
:li.
There is a new setting on page 1 of the XFolder Global
Settings which tells XFolder what to do after :link reftype=hd res=10041.creating
an object from a template&per.:elink. 
.br
:li.
"XFolder" settings page in every folder&per. 
.br
:li.
XFolder now also replaces the WPObject class in order
to be able to suppress menu items for all Desktop objects&per.
Moreover, "Check disk" and "Format disk" can be removed
from WPDisk objects&per. :link reftype=hd res=10083.Settings:elink. page 2 has been redesigned
for all this&per. 
.br
:li.
My "Netscape DDE Interface" is now included in this
package&per. See :link reftype=hd res=10017."Related files":elink. for more&per. 
.br
:li.
Added "Close window" to the configurable hotkey items
list&per. (Some people seem to prefer "Alt+X" over "Alt+F4"
to close windows&per.) 
.br
:li.
:link reftype=hd res=10017.REPCLASS&per.EXE:elink. now explains itself when started without
parameters&per. 
.br
:li.
:link reftype=hd res=10017.WPSRESET&per.EXE:elink. rewritten&per. 
.br
:li.
Rearranged buttons in all messages boxes to conform
with the OS/2 look and feel&per. 
:eul.
:p.
Bugfixes&colon. 
:ul compact.:li.
"Full path in window title" is now ALWAYS properly updated,
even when you move parent folders of an open folder&per.
Thanks to multithreading! 
.br
:li.
Several users have reported problems when Object Desktop
was installed and "unusual" folders (such as workarea
folders and URL folders) were opened&per. This would
completely mess up the WPS, unless folder hotkeys were
disabled&per. This problem should be fixed now, because
I've finally implemented a proper way of remembering
window procedures for each folder window separately&per.
The old code was just awful, sorry&per. 
.br
:li.
I know I've claimed before that this one was fixed,
but when passing directory names to programs as a parameter,
XFolder still forgot to enclose them in quotes when
they contain spaces&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
XFolder was previously unable to differentiate between
"Alt" and "Ctrl" hotkeys&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
:link reftype=hd res=10017.NEWOBJ&per.CMD:elink. can now handle titles with spaces also&per.
Thanks, John Buckley&per.

Version 0&per.52 (March 1, 1998):ehp2. New features&colon.

:ul compact.:li.
Many more configurable items for :link reftype=hd res=10053.folder hotkeys:elink., including
sorting, NPS WPS's "Sort by extension" and OS/2 Warp
4 items&per. 
.br
:li.
XFolder is now prepared for :link reftype=hd res=10039.National Language Support:elink.&per.
It shouldn't take too long before more than just the
English version is available&per. I am planning to distribute
National Language Support files in separate packages&per.
NLS support is now on page 5 of the Global Settings,
to where I also moved two settings which were formerly
on page 1&per. Please :link reftype=hd res=10025.contact the developer's team:elink. if
you're interested in translating XWorkplace to your
language&per. You don't have to be a programmer, but
knowing HTML would help&per. 
.br
:li.
A few renovations on the settings pages&colon. most
importantly, settings which don't apply are now grayed
out&per. 
:eul.
:p.
Even more bugfixes&colon. 
:ul compact.:li.
Sometimes hotkeys got activated even though the Ctrl
or Alt keys were not pressed&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
When the folder name was passed to a started program
as a parameter which was started from a WPDisk object,
only the drive letter was passed (e&per.g&per. "C&colon."
instead of "C&colon.\")&per. Fixed&per. 
.br
:li.
Previous versions had problems replacing the default
icon for closed icons, but only on Warp 4&per. Apparently,
on Warp 4, IBM has decided to have wpclsQueryIconData
call BEFORE wpclsInitData, which is really not the way
it should be and, even worse, contradictory to what
IBM recommends in the Toolkit Docs&per. Anyway, this
is fixed now&per. 
.br
:li.
Not really a bugfix, but the hotkey list now uses less
space in OS2&per.INI&per. 
.br
:li.
No bugfix either, but the annoying "No settings found"
message box after opening the settings notebook was
removed&per. 
.br

I forgot to implement "Remove default menu items" and
help for disk objects also&per. Fixed&per.

Version 0&per.51 (Feb 20, 1998):ehp2. New features&colon.

Insert separators into menus&colon. simply set a program
object's title to "---"&per.

"Refresh now" also updates the window title (if "Full
path in window titles" is enabled)&per. 
.br

At last, XFolder enhances Drive objects also (i&per.e&per.
the root drive views that can be opened from the "Drives"
folder)&per. Hotkeys still DO NOT work in here&per.

.br

Added a few more items to the configurable hotkey list&per.

.br

Two more REXX scripts for folder settings&per.

Bugfixes (this is a long list, but I believe nothing
of this was really serious)&colon. 
:ul compact.:li.
Somehow in the last compile of V0&per.50 the help panels
for the "System" notebook pages got messed up&per. Fixed&per.

.br
:li.
Cleaned up internal menu handling routines&per. Removed
a few weirdos&per. 
.br
:li.
The hotkey entry field in the Settings now only works
when a list box entry has been selected&per. Anything
else didn't make much sense&per. 
.br
:li.
When the settings were re-read from OS2&per.INI at startup,
not all the keyboard hotkeys were initialized, so some
of the definitions got lost at every reboot&per. Fixed&per.

.br
:li.
For some reason, in the last beta, you could add up
to 20 hotkeys, but you could not get rid of them any
more&per. I simply forgot to add a "Clear" button, which
is available now&per. 
.br
:li.
The "full path in folder title" was not updated when
the folder was moved or renamed&per. This now works
half way&per. 
.br
:li.
Removed annoying "XFolder could not query its module
handle" message, which was titled a "fatal error", but
caused no harm in any way&per. 
.br
:li.
Changed default "menu ID offset" setting to 300 to avoid
conflicts with LAN Server and ObjectDesktop from the
start&per. 
.br
:li.
Install program now backs up the original XFolder Configuration
Folder before erasing it and building a new one from
scratch&per. This avoids having duplicate entries in
the XFolder menus after several installs&per. 
.br
:li.
The missing "TREEFONT" setup string has been added to
the :link reftype=hd res=10146."WPFolder Setup Strings":elink. page&per. 
.br
:li.
One more thing&colon. somehow I got the terminology
for "conditional cascade" menus messed up&per. The description
on the first settings page has been corrected&per.

Version 0&per.50 beta (Feb 10, 1998):ehp2. New features&colon.

:link reftype=hd res=10053.Folder hotkeys&per.:elink. 
.br
:li.
Moved all the XFolder Global Settings onto four pages
in the OS/2 "System" object in the System Setup folder&per.
I thought that since there are a number of settings
for folders there, I might just as well add XFolder's
settings in that place also&per. 
:eul.:hp2.

Version 0&per.41 (Feb 8, 1998):ehp2. New features&colon.

finally getting somewhere&per. New features&colon. 
:ul compact.:li.
XFolder Global Settings dialog with zillions of settings&per.
Take a look at it, it's completely new&per. In this
dialog, you can now configure certain aspects of XFolder
that some users found annoying&per. Most importantly,
you can now switch off XFolder's icon replacement&per.

.br
:li.
XFolder can now display the full path of the folder
in the folder window title (e&per.g&per. "C&colon.\OS2\APPS"
instead of just "APPS"), which is a bit more informative&per.

.br
:li.
XFolder can now also remove OS/2 default menu entries&per.

Added online help for pressing F1 over an XFolder variable

Bugfixes -- I told you, 0&per.30 was a beta only ;-)
&colon.
:ul compact.:li.
"%" in parameter lists of program objects is now also
recognized when other parameters need to be passed to
the program&per. Example&colon. "text1&per.txt %" now
works&per. The previous version only recognized "%"
when it was the only character in the parameters list&per.

.br
:li.
If the folder name contains spaces, it is now enclosed
in quotes ("folder name") before being passed as a parameter&per.
This allows Netscape to display these folders also&per.

.br
:li.
Removed faulty information displayed by the install
script&colon. the help file was NEVER copied to \OS2\HELP,
despite the announcement of the install script&per.

.br
:li.
The maximum number of objects in the config folder is
still set to 50; however, instead of crashing, XFolder
will now give you a message, asking you to remove objects&per.

:eul.:hp2.

Version 0&per.30 beta (Jan 31, 1998):ehp2. New features&colon.

:ul compact.:li.
Now all object classes are recognized in the config
folders, not only WPPrograms and WPFolders&per. 
.br
:li.
Extra functionality for WPPrograms&colon. The folder
name is passed to the program as a parameter, unless
the parameter list in the program object contains "%"
(like WPS behaviour)&per. This shall henceforth be known
as "Netscape support"&per. ;-) 
.br

Added online help for XFolder's error messages&per.
This cost me two years of my life&per.

the new features; can now also recreate the default
configuration folder only&per.

Reworked internal handling of submenus&per. The previous

Reworked large parts of this documentation&per. Window

:h2 res=10126 x=right width=70%.What Are WPS Classes?
:p.

:p.
In general, in object-oriented programming, a :hp2.class:ehp2.
is an abstract definition of both (1&per.) data types
and (2&per.) actions that can be performed on that data&per.
The latter are commonly known as object :hp2.methods:ehp2.&per.

:p.
While classes only describe an object type in an abstract
way, the objects that really exist in a program are
called :hp2.instances:ehp2. of a certain class&per. 
:p.
Take a WPS program object, for example&colon. every
program object is an instance of the class WPProgram,
defined by the WPS&per. The (1&per.) data of the program
object would be, among others, the executable associated
with it (e&per.g&per. "CMD&per.EXE"), while (2&per.)
methods (that could be performed on this data) would
be starting the executable (by double-clicking or choosing
the "Open" menu item) or changing the executable in
the settings notebook&per. While you cannot "see" methods
from the user interface, methods are used all the time
internally every time the WPS is doing something&per.
If you're familiar with that term, methods can vaguely
be described as an Application Programmer's Interface
(API) to an object&per. If you know how to program REXX&colon.
every time you use one of those object :link reftype=hd res=10146.setup strings:elink.
to modify an object's data, you're actually calling
a method upon an object&per. 
:p.
Since methods are defined for each class, the methods
that you can call on an object depend on the class of
the object&per. I have not counted them, but already
WPObject, the most basic WPS class, defines more than
100 methods&per. 
:p.
What makes object-oriented programming so flexible (and
popular) is that you can define relationships between
classes&per. In order to understand this, the following
two concepts are helpful&colon. 
:ul compact.:li.
:hp2.Inheritance&per.:ehp2. This concept allows you to define an
object class that takes over all its data types and
methods from another object class, without requiring
that the programmer know how the original class was
actually programmed&per. You can simple "take over"
the features of an existing class and rewrite only what
you wish to implement&per. The original class is then
called the "ancestor" or "parent" of the "descendant"
class&per. 
:p.
For example, with the Workplace Shell, the Desktop class
(called "WPDesktop") is derived from the folder class
(called "WPFolder"), making the Desktop just a special
type of folder&per. 
:p.
So basically, the Desktop has all the capabilities of
a regular folder&colon. you can put other objects into
it, sort its contents, open a tree or details view,
and so on&per. But in addition, the Desktop class provides
a few more actions&colon. its context menu contains
more items (such as "Shutdown" and "System configuration"),
its notebook has more pages, and so on&per. Obviously,
the Desktop inherits folders' characteristics, but adds
a few more&per. On the other hand side, some folder
characteristics are suppressed&colon. for example, you
cannot close the active Desktop, and it does not have
a title bar&per. 
:p.
The WPS implements a derivative structure such that
all objects are logically grouped and interdependent&per.
On an even more abstract level, all object classes of
the WPS are descendants of a SINGLE CLASS named "WPObject",
which provides certain functions that all Desktop objects
need&colon. mainly the ability to display context menus
and notebooks at all and things like that&per. This
is typical of object-oriented programming; such a global
ancestor class is commonly called the "root class" of
a "class hierarchy"&per. 
:p.
On WPObject, the WPS builds a complete tree of classes
known as the :link reftype=hd res=10099.WPS class hierarchy:elink.&per. You can use the
"WPS Classes" page in XWorkplace's :link reftype=hd res=10082."WPS class list":elink.
object to take a look at this&per. 
:p.
Such a class hierarchy has the advantage that one can
change the characteristics of this root class only,
and all classes which are derived from it will also
change&per. (The disadvantage is -- from a programmer's
point of view -- that building such a class hierarchy
requires a whole lot of planning which data and which
methods are common to which classes, and many times
it turns out that this planning wasn't quite optimal&per.
But once this hierarchy has been built in a thoughtful
way -- which, thanks to IBM, indeed is the case with
the WPS -- the advantages are just superb&per.) 
.br
:li.
:hp2.Polymorphism&per.:ehp2. This concept means that, while using
inheritance, you can REPLACE certain characteristics
of an ancestor class with new ones&per. You can redefine
("override") the original object class's behavior&per.
Now, if a certain method is performed on the descendant,
the newly defined method is called instead of the one
that was defined with the ancestor class&per. 
:p.
Just one of the many examples of this can be seen with
the "Help" menu item which is available in every object's
context menu&per. Selecting the "Extended help" menu
item will result in an object's :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.wpDisplayHelp:font facename=default size=0x0. method
to be called&per. This method is introduced by the by
the WPS root class, WPObject, so that all Desktop objects
can display help&colon. the OS/2 help manager is initialized,
the help window is displayed, etc&per. The actual help
page to be displayed however is overridden (following
the concept of polymorphism) by almost every single
WPS class&per. This way, pressing "Help" in a folder's
context menu will show you something different than
from, say, in a program object's menu&per. 
:eul.
:p.
While inheritance and polymorphism are concepts common
to every object-oriented programming environment (and
also to object-oriented languages, such as C++), the
Workplace Shell is even able to provide their advantages
across several applications&per. The WPS consists of
many DLLs which are in part independent of each other,
and programmer's outside of IBM can extend the WPS using
these features without even having the WPS's source
code, which is not possible with "normal" object-oriented
languages&per. 
:p.
This only works because the WPS uses IBM's own :hp2.System
Object Model (SOM),:ehp2. a complex system which provides
object-oriented programming interfaces even across several
code modules, and even independent of the programming
language&per. SOM is so powerful because classes are
instantiated and maintained at run-time instead of compilation
time&per. 
:p.
This is, by the way, where the WPS class list comes
in&colon. when the WPS is booting up, it creates all
the classes (which, in SOM, are objects too, but this
is a complex issue), and establishes the relationships
between them only at this point&per. Only because of
this is it possible to modify classes without IBM, who
created the originals, even knowing about it&per. 
:p.
Just as a short personal opinion, this is still something
that makes OS/2 unique in today's computer world&per.
While most of its other advantages over other operating
systems, such as its reliable multitasking, are not
that unique any more (e&per.g&per. Linux is pretty good
at that, too), the user interface is still not reached
by any operating system that I know&per. Especially
not Windows 95&per.

:h2 res=10127 x=right width=70%.How Does XWorkplace Work?
:p.
XWorkplace registers and/or replaces a whole number
of WPS classes&per. Take a look at the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.INSTALL&per.CMD:font facename=default size=0x0.
script in the XWorkplace installation directory to find
out more about this&per. 
:p.
The most important XWorkplace class replacements are&colon.

:ol compact.:li.
:hp2.XFolder:ehp2. for regular folders, which contains the main
functionality of XWorkplace, 
.br
:li.
:hp2.XFldDisk:ehp2. for "disk" objects, which appear in the "Drives"
folder, 
.br
:li.
:hp2.XFldObject,:ehp2. the WPS root class, for being able to access
a whole number of WPS internals, and 
.br
:li.
:hp2.XFldDesktop:ehp2. for the new Desktop features, especially
the eXtended Shutdown procedure&per. 
:eol.
:p.
All these classes replace the original WPS classes&per.

:p.
In the sense described on the :link reftype=hd res=10126.previous page:elink., the :hp2.XFolder
class:ehp2. is a descendant of the WPFolder class&per. This
way, it can do everything that a regular folder can&per.
As a new function, it adds new context menu items to
all folders, allows for folder hotkeys, changes the
folder window titles, etc&per. 
:p.
By using polymorphism, XFolder redefines certain WPFolder
methods, as described below&per. 
:p.
However, XFolder is then registered with the WPS as
a WPFolder :hp2.replacement,:ehp2. meaning that the WPS will use
the XFolder class as its standard folder class, instead
of WPFolder&per. In doing so, the WPFolder class is
not any more used directly, but only through its replacement
(and descendant) class, XFolder&per. 
:p.
Some of the WPFolder methods that the :hp2.XFolder class:ehp2.
overrides are (this will probably only of interest for
programmers)&colon. 
:ul compact.:li.
:hp2.:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.wpModifyPopupMenu:font facename=default size=0x0.&colon.:ehp2. This WPObject method is called
by the WPS just before an object's context menu is displayed&per.
Each WPS class adds its own, class-specific menu items
here&per. 
:p.
Since XFolder plays with menus a lot, this is one of
the most important methods which XFolder overrides&per.
In this method, XFolder first calls the parent class's
(WPFolder's) :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.wpModifyPopupMenu:font facename=default size=0x0. to have all the standard
menu items added to the object's context menu&per. 
:p.
It then searches for the XFolder configuration folder
(which must have the object ID :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.<XFOLDER_CONFIG>:font facename=default size=0x0.)
and populates it invisibly&per. Now it goes through
all objects in here, adding submenus and menu items
to the context menu accordingly&per. If the configuration
folder is not found, a message box pops up and an empty
folder with the aforementioned ID is created on the
desktop&per. 
:p.
The same is done for the "Folder content" functions
and "favorite" folders&per. However, these submenus
are only filled with objects after they are opened by
the user; this is done by intercepting the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WM_INITMENU:font facename=default size=0x0.
message in the subclassed folder frame window procedure
(see below)&per. XFolder also subclasses these submenu
windows (and only these) to be able to paint icons and
to intercept mouse button 2 for opening a folder&per.

:p.
(Please note that "subclassing" here has nothing to
do with WPS classes, but is the Presentation Manager
terminology for using a different message procedure
for an existing window in order to be able to intercept
certain PM messages for that window&per. This is done
using the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WinSubclassWindow:font facename=default size=0x0. API&per.) 
:p.
XFolder also modifies various other menus (such as the
the "Sort" submenu) in this method, if the Global Settings
allow this, and adds other menu items, if these have
been enabled in the Global Settings&per. 
.br
:li.
:hp2.:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.wpMenuItemSelected:font facename=default size=0x0.&colon.:ehp2. This is called by the WPS
whenever a context menu item is selected by the user&per.

:p.
XFolder checks if one of its own (variable) menu items
was selected; if so, it finds the corresponding object
in the configuration folder and opens it&per. If this
object is of the WPProgram class, XWorkplace performs
the usual tricks on it (see the context help for the
XWorkplace Configuration Folder for details)&per. If
the object is a template, no matter of what WPS class,
it is not opened, but XFolder creates a new object from
it in the current folder (via :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.wpCreateFromTemplate:font facename=default size=0x0.)&per.

:p.
If the selected item is one from the "folder content"
submenus, the corresponding object is simply opened&per.

:p.
If any of the other menu items that XFolder adds to
context menus are selected, XFolder itself will perform
the respective action internally&per. 
:p.
If none of the XFolder menu items was selected, the
parent class's (WPFolder's) :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.wpMenuItemSelected:font facename=default size=0x0. method
is called (in order not to prevent the standard menu
items from functioning)&per. 
.br
:li.
:hp2.:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.wpMenuItemHelpSelected:font facename=default size=0x0.&colon.:ehp2. This is called by the
WPS whenever you press :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.F1:font facename=default size=0x0. over a context menu item&per.
XFolder will display a proper help page, if necessary&per.

.br
:li.
:hp2.:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.wpFilterPopupMenu:font facename=default size=0x0.&colon.:ehp2. With this method, XFolder removes
those default menu entries from the context menus that
you have specified in the Global Settings&per. (This
method is called by the WPS even before wpModifyPopupMenu,
so first items are removed, then new items are inserted&per.)

.br
:li.
:hp2.:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.wpclsQueryTitle:font facename=default size=0x0.&colon.:ehp2. The string :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.XFolder:font facename=default size=0x0. (or whatever
you have specified in the Global Settings) is returned
to give the XFolder class a unique name&per. 
.br
:li.
:hp2.:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.wpOpen:font facename=default size=0x0.&colon.:ehp2. This routine is called by the WPS every
time a folder (and any other object also) is opened&per.
XFolder needs to override this method to implement a
whole number of features&per. 
:p.
First, the parent method is called to have the folder
view opened&colon. the WPS will create a window with
a container control in it and shows this window&per.

:p.
XFolder then intercepts the frame window handle, with
which it can then modify the folder's window title and
reset it to the folders complete path (if enabled in
the Global Settings)&per. Basically, it's a simple :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WinSetWindowText:font facename=default size=0x0.
call, with just a few calculations to truncate the title
if necessary&per. 
:p.
In this method, XFolder also :hp2.subclasses:ehp2. the folder frame
window in order to be able to handle WM_CHAR messages
for folder hotkeys and lots of other things&per. For
subclassing, this method seemed the best place to me,
since all necessary WPS initializiation stuff has been
done by calling the parent method, but the user cannot
interact with the folder yet, because it will only be
filled with objects ("populated" in WPS terminology)
on a different thread afterwards&per. 
:p.
In the new window procedure, XFolder intercepts all
WM_CHAR messages (which are only passed to the frame
window procedure if they have not yet been processed
by the container already, such as cursor keys) and evaluates
them according to its internal hotkey list, which can
be changed in the Global Settings&per. 
:p.
Subclassing is also needed to introduce folder status
bars; the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WM_QUERYFRAMECTLCOUNT:font facename=default size=0x0., :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WM_FORMATFRAME:font facename=default size=0x0., and
:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WM_CALCFRAMERECT:font facename=default size=0x0. messages are intercepted to resize
the folder frame and its container child window according
to the space needed for the folder status bar&per. 
:p.
XFolder also intercepts a few container notification
messages in order to provide the "Auto-scroll Tree views"
feature and update the status bar text if object selections
have been changed by the user&per. 
:p.
In addition, XFolder intercepts various menu messages,
such as :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WM_INITMENU:font facename=default size=0x0. and :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WM_MENUSELECT:font facename=default size=0x0., to be able to
handle some menu functions which are not accessible
through regular WPS methods&per. 
:p.
All messages which have no meaning to XFolder are passed
on to the original window procedure&per. 
:p.
The :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.wpOpen:font facename=default size=0x0. method is also needed for implementing the
XFolder extended sort functions; XFolder updates the
container settings according to the sort criteria which
you have specified&per. 
.br
:li.
:hp2.:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.wpAddSettingsPages:font facename=default size=0x0.&colon.:ehp2. This method is called by the
WPS every time an object's settings notebook is opened&per.
XFolder overrides this method also to add its own settings
pages, after having called the parent method, so that
the original settings pages are still inserted&per.

:eul.
:p.
The :hp2.XFldDisk:ehp2. class, which replaces the WPDisk class,
does not do much, aside from routing its methods to
the XFolder method counterparts, so that drive views
act just like normal (X)folders&per. IBM has, for some
reason, chosen not to make disk objects regular folders,
but implemented a different class for them (called WPRootFolder),
so XFolder needs a separate class too&per. :hp2.
:p.
XFldObject:ehp2. doesn't do much visibly either, except for
suppressing OS/2 default menu items and adding the "Copy
filename" feature&per. It is however required by other
XFolder parts internally in order to be notified of
some internal WPS events, especially the XShutdown feature,
which is described in detail on the :link reftype=hd res=10128.next page:elink.&per. 
:p.
The :hp2.XFldDesktop:ehp2. class is implemented to allow changing
the Desktop menu items and for XShutdown, which is described
in detail on the :link reftype=hd res=10128.next page:elink.&per. 
:p.
While previous versions also replaced the :hp2.WPSystem:ehp2. class
so that the "System" object in the "System setup" folder
contained more notebook pages to access XFolder's Global
Settings, with V0&per.80 this behavior has changed&per.
Instead, XFolder registers two new classes derived from
WPSystem without replacing it&per. These two classes
are :hp2.XFldSystem:ehp2. and :hp2.XFldWPS:ehp2. for the "OS/2 Kernel" and
"Workplace Shell" objects, respectively&per. The settings
that you specify here are (mostly) stored in OS2&per.INI
and evaluated every time XFolder needs them (e&per.g&per.
when you open a context menu)&per. In contrast, the
"local" XFolder settings for an individual folder are
stored in its &per.CLASSINFO Extended Attributes, where
the WPS also stores the other folder settings&per. This
is then done by the XFolder class&per. 
:p.
Please note that all the XFolder classes are designed
to interact&per. Do not try to remove only SOME of them,
or XFolder might behave in a funny way (if you're lucky)&per.
All of XFolder's features have been made fairly configurable,
so you should be able to get rid of what you don't like
-- or to get rid of XFolder altogether&per. 
.br

.* Source file: "further_2howxshutdown.html"
:h2 res=10128 x=right width=70%.How Does XShutdown Work?
:p.
The XShutdown feature has cost me a lot of thought,
because it is really not documented anywhere what happens
during the normal shutdown process&per. 
:p.
OS/2 per default knows two different shutdown APIs&colon.

:ul compact.:li.
:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.DosShutdown:font facename=default size=0x0. only closes all open files, flushes all
file-system buffers und unmounts all file systems; this
is what happens after pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del&per. No
applications are properly closed, and the WPS is not
saved&per. 
.br
:li.
:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WinShutdownSystem:font facename=default size=0x0. however is the Presentation Manager
API which closes all windows, saves the WPS and finally
calls :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.DosShutdown:font facename=default size=0x0.&per. Just the regular shutdown procedure
that you are used to&colon. this is executed when you
select "Shutdown" from the Desktop's context menu or
the respective icons from the Launchpad or WarpCenter&per.

:eul.
:p.
Trouble is, there is no function "in between" these
two&per. If you call :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.DosShutdown:font facename=default size=0x0. the WPS data is not
saved&per. And if you call :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WinShutdownSystem:font facename=default size=0x0. you get
the regular shutdown without any further chance to interfere&per.
So basically, I had to recode a complete new :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WinShutdownSystem:font facename=default size=0x0.,
which will now be explained&per. This was quite difficult,
since IBM hardly explains anything about what is really
going on during :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WinShutdownSystem:font facename=default size=0x0.&per. 
:p.
Note&colon. In XWorkplace, the "eXtended Shutdown" and
"Restart Desktop" routines share the same code; they
only differ in what happens after all windows have been
closed&per. I will thus use the term "XShutdown" in
the following explanations for both features, unless
otherwise stated&per. 
:p.
XShutdown is :hp2.integrated into the WPS:ehp2. and relies heavily
on the XWorkplace class replacements&per. I have intentionally
not put the XShutdown code into a separate &per.EXE
file for two reasons&colon. for one, XShutdown needs
access to WPS internal data, which is only available
from the SOM context; second, I want to prevent people
from trying to use XShutdown separately, without having
the XWorkplace classes installed, because this could
severely damage the Workplace Shell&per. In more detail,
XShutdown relies on the XFldObject replacement class
and the XWorkplace Worker thread, which cooperatively
keep track of the WPS internal data&per. 
:p.
To understand what XShutdown is now doing, it is necessary
to understand how the :hp2.WPS handles its objects:ehp2. internally&per.
Every single object which becomes relevant to the WPS
at some point, be it through populating a folder or
querying its settings or starting a program or whatever,
is -- in WPS terminology -- "awakened" by the system,
which means that it exists as a SOM object in memory&per.

:p.
The WPS only very rarely puts awake objects back to
sleep though, which would free the associated memory
and store the object's data back to disk&per. This has
two consequences&colon. 
:ol compact.:li.
There are always many more awakened objects on your
system than you would actually think, because most of
them aren't currently visible&per. Even after you close
an open folder, the objects therein remain awake; this
speeds up populating the folder when it's opened a second
time&per. As a result however, the WPS eats up more
and more of your memory with each folder you open&per.
(If you have turned on the XShutdown log file, you can
see how many awake objects were saved by XShutdown;
these are usually several hundred objects, even though
XShutdown doesn't save all awake objects, but only descendants
of WPFolder and WPAbstract&per. On the "Internals" page
in the Desktop's settings notebook you can take a look
at how many objects are currently awake&per.) 
.br
:li.
A change to the object's data sometimes has only an
effect on the SOM object in memory, but is not always
saved to disk or the OS2&per.INI / OS2SYS&per.INI files&per.
This is why sometimes the WPS gets into trouble if you
make comprehensive changes, such as moving a folder
containing many abstract objects, and do not shutdown
properly&colon. the physical file data on disk and the
WPS records differ then&per. 
:eol.
:p.
This is what XShutdown needs the :hp2.XFldObject:ehp2. class for,
which replaces WPObject&per. Every time an object is
awakened, the WPS calls several methods (among them
:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.wpInitData:font facename=default size=0x0. and :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.wpObjectReady:font facename=default size=0x0.)&per. XFldObject overrides
these and passes the object address in memory to the
Worker thread, which will then properly update an XWorkplace-internal
list of all currently awake objects&per. As far as I
know, there is no other way to find out which objects
are currently awake; at least there is no documented
API for enumerating them&per. 
:p.
Now, when :hp2.XShutdown is initiated:ehp2. and confirmed, it first
starts two new threads for the following shutdown procedure,
which run parallel to the regular WPS threads&colon.
the main :hp2."Shutdown thread":ehp2. with the message queue for
the status window, and the :hp2."Update thread",:ehp2. which monitors
the OS/2 Window List and posts messages to the main
shutdown thread, if the status window needs to be updated&per.
So closing all currently open windows is a fairly complex
process of interaction between these two threads&colon.
the Shutdown thread closes a window and then goes to
sleep until the Update thread has detected a change
in the Window List (which means that the window has
successfully been closed) and posts a message back to
the Shutdown thread, which then in turn closes the next
window, until all windows are closed&per. 
:p.
When all windows are closed, the Update thread exits&per.
Now the Shutdown thread goes through the list of currently
awake objects (which was described above) and forces
saving their data to the INI files or to disk by calling
each object's :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.wpSaveImmediate:font facename=default size=0x0. method&per. This is only
done for WPAbstract and WPFolder descendants, because
from my experience, all other classes save their data
synchroneously&per. (I have tried saving all WPFileSystem
descendants once, and this caused a lot of extended
attributes to be created for every single file that
was ever awakened by the WPS&per. In addition, shutdown
took ages then&per.) 
:p.
Finally, depending on what action was desired, the Shutdown
thread does one of the following&colon. 
:ul compact.:li.
If you selected :hp2."Restart Desktop",:ehp2. the Shutdown thread
simply executes :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.DosExit(EXIT_PROCESS, 0):font facename=default size=0x0.&per. Since
XWorkplace is part of the Workplace process, and all
parts of the WPS are running in this one process (the
second instance of :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.PMSHELL&per.EXE:font facename=default size=0x0.), this will terminate
the whole Workplace Shell&per. The Shell process (the
first instance of :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.PMSHELL&per.EXE:font facename=default size=0x0.) will then restart
the WPS automatically&per. 
.br
:li.
If you selected "Shutdown" and :hp2."Reboot afterwards",:ehp2.
XShutdown now also saves the INI files to disk&per.
This is necessary, because :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.DosShutdown,:font facename=default size=0x0. which is called
afterwards, does not save them either&per. (I guess
it's because the INI file API's belong to Presentation
Manager&per.) Since the PM INI file API's prohibit simply
closing the user and system profiles (which does write
their data to disk for all other profiles), XWorkplace
copies them to two temporary profiles, deletes the originals,
and then renames the temporary profiles to the names
of the originals&per. After :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.DosShutdown:font facename=default size=0x0. ("Releasing
file systems&per.&per.&per."), the system is rebooted
via a call to the DOS&per.SYS device driver&per. This
feature is documented in :link reftype=hd res=10153.EDM/2:elink. volume 5, issue 9&per.

.br
:li.
If you selected "Shutdown" and :hp2.NOT "Reboot afterwards",:ehp2.
after :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.DosShutdown,:font facename=default size=0x0. XShutdown disables the window list
and then simply blocks the system by calling :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.DosEnterCritSec:font facename=default size=0x0.
and staying in an infinite loop&per. Since all file
systems are closed, no further action should be possible,
except for turning off your computer or pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del&per.

.* Source file: "further_2howxtrash.html"
:h2 res=10129 x=right width=70%.How Does the Trash Can Work?
:p.
Even though the trash can looks like a normal folder,
it behaves quite differently internally&per. 
:ul compact.:li.
When an :hp2.object is deleted:ehp2. into the trash can (either
by dropping it onto the trash can or by selecting "Delete"
from the object's context menu), it is :hp1.not:ehp1. physically
moved into the trash can folder (which, being a folder,
is a regular directory on the disk)&per. 
:p.
Instead, the following happens&colon. 
.br

:ol compact.:li.
The trash can then creates an invisible directory in
the root directory of the drive where the object resides&per.
This directory is always called :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.\TRASH:font facename=default size=0x0.&per. (You can
see it by typing :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.DIR /A \:font facename=default size=0x0. on the command line&per.)

.br
:li.
The trash can then creates a subpath in that hidden
directory according to the path where the object currently
resides&per. That is, for example, if the object is
in the folder :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.D&colon.\MYFILES\ARTICLES:font facename=default size=0x0., the directory
:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.D&colon.\TRASH\MYFILES\ARTICLES:font facename=default size=0x0. is created&per. This
allows the trash can to remember where the object was
deleted from&per. 
.br
:li.
The object is then moved into :hp1.that:ehp1. directory (and not
the actual trash can folder)&per. 
:p.
The reason for this is simple&colon. speed&per. If we
were physically moving objects into the trash can folder,
this would frequently move files across drives&per.
(Just think about moving a 30 MB file into the trash
can this way&per.) By contrast, since the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.\TRASH:font facename=default size=0x0. directory
is always on the same drive as the object, even moving
large folder trees should take place very fast&per.

.br
:li.
In order to still make the object visible in the trash
can itself, an instance of XWPTrashObject is created
in the trash can&per. This class is a subclass of WPTransient,
which means that it is not persistent between Desktop
restarts, but only while the WPS is running&per. As
a result, these "trash objects" do not consume any space
in OS2&per.INI&per. 
:p.
So when an object is moved to the trash can, it is actually
duplicated&colon. the "real" object is moved to the
invisible :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.\TRASH:font facename=default size=0x0. directory tree, and a "trash object"
(XFldTrashObject, WPTransient subclass) is created in
the trash can&per. 
:eol.
:p.

.br
:li.
When the :hp2.trash can is opened:ehp2. (and thus populated), all
drives are scanned for the hidden :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.\TRASH:font facename=default size=0x0. directories,
and trash objects are created according to the objects
which reside in the subdirectories in there&per. 
.br
:li.
When an :hp2.object is restored:ehp2. (or moved out of the trash
can), the corresponding "real" object in the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.\TRASH:font facename=default size=0x0.
directories is moved back to where it was deleted from
(or to the location where the user is moving it to),
and the trash object in the trash can is destroyed,
since it serves no longer any purpose&per. 
.br
:li.
When an :hp2.object is destroyed:ehp2. (or the trash can is emptied
altogether), all objects in the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.\TRASH:font facename=default size=0x0. directories are
destroyed, and all trash objects in the trash can are
destroyed also&per. 
:eul.
:p.
This approach seemed like a good compromise for speed
and stability, while not messing with the WPS internals
too much&per. I had initially thought about using a
subclass of WPAbstract for the trash can, but this would
create lots of entries in OS2&per.INI with the usual
problems associated with that&per. 
:p.
Besides, using a subclass of WPTransient has another
advantage&per. Since the trash objects (the transient
objects) are recreated from scratch after every WPS
restart, if something goes wrong really bad, you can
manually delete all the hidden :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.\TRASH:font facename=default size=0x0. directories on
all drives, and after the next Desktop startup, the
trash can is completely empty&per. 
.br

.* Source file: "further_2howxx1_hook.html"
:h2 res=10130 x=right width=70%.How Does the XWorkplace PM Hook work?
:p.
In general, a Presentation Manager (PM) hook is a piece
of code which is registered with PM to receive all messages
which are going through the system&per. As a result,
that piece of code effectively becomes part of every
process on the system which is processing messages&per.

:p.
With PM (and Windows too), windows communicate with
:hp2.messages&per.:ehp2. The system sends messages to windows automatically
for all kinds of events, and windows can send messages
to each other as well&per. There are hundreds of different
system messages, and application can define their own
messages too&per. 
:p.
For example, if you click on any window with the left
mouse button, that window is sent the the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WM_BUTTON1CLICK:font facename=default size=0x0.
message by the system&per. What happens then depends
on the type (in PM&colon. the class) of the window&per.
For example, a container control will look if there's
a container record under the mouse pointer and, if so,
select the corresponding record&per. A Netscape client
window will see if there's a link under the mouse pointer
and, if so, load a new HTML page to follow the link&per.

:p.
There are many more "important" system messages, such
as :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WM_CHAR:font facename=default size=0x0. (for keystrokes), :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WM_SIZE:font facename=default size=0x0. (when windows are
resized), :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WM_PAINT:font facename=default size=0x0. (when windows need repainting), and
:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WM_DESTROY:font facename=default size=0x0. (when windows are destroyed)&per. That's
basically why PM programming seems so complicated at
first, because PM programming mostly means reacting
to messages, which is quite different from "regular"
programming, where programs are normally simply processing
tasks sequentially&per. With PM, if no messages are
queued for a window, a program normally simply does
nothing&per. Its threads are blocked until messages
come in&per. 
:p.
Now, when a :hp2.global message hook function:ehp2. is registered
with the system, all messages go through that hook function
:hp1.before:ehp1. the target window receives that message&per.
This way a hook function can choose to modify the message,
redirect it to a different window, do something completely
different itself, or even swallow the message so that
the target window won't receive it&per. 
:p.
This is how all the well-known PM hook utilities (such
NPS WPS, FeelX, ProgramCommander/2, X-it, Styler/2,
and the XWorkplace PM hook as well) work&per. They intercept
certain messages and manipulate them&per. 
:p.
For example, every time the XWorkplace PM hook encounters
a :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WM_CHAR:font facename=default size=0x0. message (that is, when a key on the keyboard
is pressed or released), it will check if that key is
on the global hotkeys list&per. If so, the message is
swallowed (so that the target window won't receive it)
and some part of the XWorkplace WPS code is notified
instead, which can then open the corresponding object
which has been defined by the user for that hotkey&per.

:p.
The way the XWorkplace hook is implemented differs slightly
from that of the typical hook utilities&per. Most of
those utilities register their hook function with PM
when they are started and de-register the hook again
when the program is ended (for example, if "close" is
chosen from the window list)&per. 
:p.
Instead, XWorkplace's PM hook is registered from a special
program which is not visible in the window list -- the
:hp2.XWorkplace daemon,:ehp2. :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.XWPDAEMN&per.EXE:font facename=default size=0x0.&per. You can see
it with WatchCat or any other process lister though&per.
Try killing that program&colon. you will see that all
hook functionality will be gone&per. :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.
:p.
XWPDAEMN&per.EXE:font facename=default size=0x0. is started by XWorkplace while the
WPS is starting up for the first time and keeps running
until the system is shut down&per. That is, the daemon
even keeps running between Desktop restarts&per. 
:p.
Even though the daemon is a PM program, it doesn't create
any windows (except for the XPager window, see below)&per.

:p.
All this is pretty complex in detail because this involves
using shared memory and proper serialization techniques
such as shared mutex semaphores and cross-process messaging,
especially since the hook is configured from WPS settings
pages, which are running in the WPS process&per. But
I hope you get the basic idea&per. 
:p.
There are a number of good reasons why I chose that
approach&colon. 
:ol compact.:li.
It's usually not a good idea to start hooks from the
:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.PMSHELL&per.EXE:font facename=default size=0x0. process, which all WPS classes are running
in&per. If the WPS crashes, it's more difficult to clean
up installed hooks because the WPS is so complex in
itself&per. 
.br
:li.
Since the daemon keeps running between Desktop restarts,
it can also keep track of certain data which is needed
between Desktop restarts&per. For example, the XWorkplace
startup folder shouldn't be processed again when the
WPS is restarted (unless the user requests this)&per.
Try it out&colon. If you kill the daemon and then restart
the WPS, you'll see that the XWorkplace startup folder
will get processed again, because the XWorkplace WPS
classes see that the daemon is not running and then
think that the WPS is starting up for the first time&per.

.br
:li.
XPager is part of the daemon as well and is thus independent
of the WPS&per. XPager requires lots of message monitoring
as well since it needs to know about window creation
and destruction&per. At any point in time, XPager knows
about every single window on the system&per. It's much
easier for XPager to keep its own windows apart from
the rest of the system when it's running in a separate
process&per. 
:p.
For details about XPager, see :link reftype=hd res=10080."How it works":elink. in the
:link reftype=hd res=10010.XPager section&per.:elink.

.* Source file: "further_3develop.html"
:h2 res=10131 x=right width=70%.How Was XWorkplace Developed?
:p.
XWorkplace is programmed in C, using the Warp 3 Developer's
Toolkit&per. All XFolder versions until 0&per.72 were
programmed using the IBM C-Set/2 compiler&per. Thanks
to the generous support of Mark Mellin, who sent me
VisualAge C++ 3&per.0, all versions from XFolder 0&per.80
(that is, XWorkplace too) will have been compiled using
that compiler, which has a number of helpful improvements
over the earlier IBM compilers&per. 
:p.
I got my C-Set/2 from the German OS/2 magazine "OS/2
Inside", which was said to be the best OS/2 printing
in the world&per. They had a CD-ROM for just some US-$
20, containing a full C-Set&per. 
:p.
I used to have the ordering address on this page, but
"OS/2 Inside" has gone out of business, and their ordering
shop has reportedly been closed down also&per. So sadly,
I know no way to obtain a cheap IBM compiler for OS/2
any more&per. 
:p.
It is still possible to write WPS classes using the
great free EMX/GCC compiler, which is available for
download at :link reftype=hd res=10172.LEO:elink. in Germany&per. The only requirement
is a Warp 3 Developer's Toolkit, unfortunately&per.

:p.
While IBM has stated that it will no longer support
SOM altoghether, it is still a great technology, although
it needs quite a bit of reading until you know what's
going on&per. 
:p.
The Warp 3 Toolkit contains everything for developing
powerful WPS classes&per. It is sufficiently documented
to understand the basic WPS functionality, enabling
me (who neither knew C nor the OS/2 API, but only OOP
with Pascal and Windows 3&per.1) to build XFolder's
basic functionality (version 0&per.11) in a triplet
of days&per. (Things become more difficult with more
sophisticated features, but that's another story&per.)

:p.
Valuable reading, aside from the Toolkit docs, can also
be found in the four IBM OS/2 V2&per.0 Redbooks, which
I found on an old Hobbes CD-ROM and which are still
available on the commonly known FTP sites&per. It is
quite outdated (dealing only with OS/2 V2&per.0), but
the system's basic concepts have pretty much remained
the same&per. 
:p.
I also strongly recommend the :link reftype=hd res=10153.Electronic Developer's
Magazine for OS/2:elink. on the WWW, which has published fabulous
articles on all aspects of OS/2 programming&per. There
are two series about WPS programming, one starting in
volume 2 issue 8, the other one in volume 5 issue 10&per.

:p.
If you have the above tools, you should be able to program
the WPS in a jiffy&per. All you still need then is a
good portion of patience, since the WPS runs in a single
process (PMSHELL&per.EXE), and bugs in your project
will make the whole thing crash repeatedly&per. Check
the helpful "Debugging WPS applications" section in
the Toolkit WPS Guide to compensate at least the most
annoying problems&per. 
.br

.* Source file: "further_4personal.html"
:h2 res=10132 x=right width=70%.Personal Note

Finally, another subjective thesis&colon. 
:p.
If IBM had managed to push an affordable compiler into
the market just three years earlier, OS/2 would be better
positioned today&per. 
:p.
At least for me, not programming OS/2 was not due to
a lack of interest, but a lack of money&per. Both the
freeware/shareware and the commercial market could have
been WAY more vital with a "Turbo Pascal for OS/2"&per.
But this problem just matches the general problems with
OS/2&colon. the best technology around, but no interest
in the mass market&per. &colon.-( 
:p.
BTW, some consolation for depressed OS/2 users can be
found on the most excellent web page "OS/2 Headquarters"

The XCenter supports widget plug-in DLLs&per. To the
XCenter, it doesn't matter whether a widget class is
built into :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.XFLDR&per.DLL:font facename=default size=0x0. itself or implemented externally
through a plug-in DLL&per. See :link reftype=hd res=10094."About plug-in DLLs":elink.
for a general introduction to this feature of the XCenter&per.

:p.
The existing :link reftype=hd res=10093.standard widget classes:elink. are partly built
into :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.XFLDR&per.DLL:font facename=default size=0x0. itself (if they make extensive use
of WPS features, such as with the object button widget),
but some of them are already implemented as plug-in
DLLs&per. This was done for two reasons&colon. first,
to test that the plug-in DLL interface actually works,
and second, to give potential developers the chance
to look at how this can be done&per. 
:p.
Please read through the :link reftype=hd res=10135.Terminology:elink. section first to
make sure you know about the wording used here&per.

:p.
Then, basically, you can start with the minimal widget
which comes with the XWorkplace binary release&per.
In this case, you do not even need the XWorkplace source
code&per. All you need is the XCenter include file,
which now comes with XWorkplace (see :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.toolkit\center&per.h:font facename=default size=0x0.)&per.

:p.
See :link reftype=hd res=10136.Step 1&colon. One header only:elink. for an introduction,
which gets more complicated with the following steps&per.

.br

.* Source file: "plug_1require.html"
:h2 res=10134 x=right width=70%.Requirements
:p.
To write a plug-in DLL, you need to be familiar with
the following&colon. 
:ol compact.:li.
The C programming language&per. There is no language
support for the OS/2 Pascal dialects at this point&per.

.br
:li.
Presentation Manager programming&per. A widget class
is essentially a PM window class (see :link reftype=hd res=10135."Terminology":elink.)&per.

:p.
If you haven't written a PM window class from scratch
before, don't worry&per. The samples will guide you,
and it isn't that difficult&per. If you know what a
window procedure is, and if you know the difference
between an owner and a parent window and :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WinSendMsg:font facename=default size=0x0.
and :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WinPostMsg:font facename=default size=0x0., you should be fine&per. Of course, the
more you know, the better&per. 
.br
:li.
You should know what a DLL is, when and why they are
used, and why a DLL is not a process&per. ;-) 
:eol.
:p.
Now for the good news&colon. You do :hp1.not:ehp1. need to know
WPS and/or SOM programming, which should be a great
relief to many contributors&per. 
:p.
Also, you can use any C compiler you want&per. Even
EMX/GCC should do&per. The only XWorkplace code that
is required are the headers that you are including,
which now come with the XWorkplace binary distribution
(in the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.toolkit:font facename=default size=0x0. directory)&per. 
:p.
If you get lost, you can always download the :link reftype=hd res=10026.complete
XWorkplace source code:elink., where you will find the source
code for the standard plug-in DLLs which come with XWorkplace
(the window list and the clock and memory monitors),
which show you in detail how it's done&per. 
.br

.* Source file: "plug_2terminology.html"
:h2 res=10135 x=right width=70%.Terminology
:p.
The following terms are used throughout this documentation,
and you should therefore be familiar with these&per.

:ul compact.:li.
An :hp2."XCenter instance":ehp2. is an object of the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.XCenter:font facename=default size=0x0. WPS
class&per. There can only be one open view per XCenter
so that an XCenter instance is identical to an XCenter
view when it's open, but there can be several XCenter
instances on the system (i&per.e&per. one for each screen
border)&per. 
:p.
Even though the XCenter itself is obviously a Desktop
object, it completely isolates the widgets from the
WPS stuff internally&per. This is why SOM/WPS programming
knowledge is not required to write a new widget class,
but you can still do WPS programming if you want to&per.

.br
:li.
A :hp2."widget":ehp2. is a PM subwindow of an open XCenter which
displays something&per. An open XCenter can contain
zero, one, or many widgets&per. Every XCenter keeps
a list of widgets together with their settings in its
SOM instance data&per. This is totally transparent to
the widgets, but if you are interested, you can view
that data on the "Widgets" page of an XCenter's settings
notebook&per. 
:p.
Again, to make that clear&colon. A widget is a separate
PM window inside the XCenter&per. 
.br
:li.
A :hp2."widget class":ehp2. defines a widget&per. Basically, it's
a PM window class with a plain C structure as a wrapper
(:link reftype=hd res=10144.:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.XCENTERWIDGETCLASS:font facename=default size=0x0.:elink.)&per. This structure holds the name
of a PM window class which is used by the XCenter to
create the PM widget windows&per. Depending on the widget
class's attributes, there can be one or several instances
of a widget class&per. If you want a different widget
in the XCenter, you need to write a widget class&per.

:p.
Writing a widget class basically boils down to writing
a PM window class (see below), with some additional
rules to follow&per. To make things easier, several
widget classes can share the same PM class though&per.

:p.
Some widget classes are built into the XCenter itself
(i&per.e&per. reside in :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.XFLDR&per.DLL:font facename=default size=0x0.), but the XCenter
can obviously load external plug-in DLLs too&per. Several
of the widget classes that come with XWorkplace have
been created as plug-ins to show you how it's done&per.
If you have the :link reftype=hd res=10026.XWorkplace source code:elink., look for the
:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.src\widgets:font facename=default size=0x0. directory&per. 
.br
:li.
A :hp2."PM window class":ehp2. is not an XCenter definition&per.&per.&per.
this is explained in detail in the :hp1.Presentation Manager
Programming Reference&per.:ehp1. 
:p.
Basically, PM organizes windows into classes&per. For
example, if you create a PM button, you invoke :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WinCreateWindow:font facename=default size=0x0.
with the name of the button window class (:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WC_BUTTON:font facename=default size=0x0.),
which is a standard window class of every OS/2 system&per.

:p.
It is possible to create new window classes though&per.
The XCenter makes use of this feature to implement widget
classes&per. So again, a widget class is a PM window
class with a bit of extra data to give the XCenter more
information about the widgets that can be created of
that class&per. 
:p.
The advantage of using separate PM window classes is
that a widget is essentially free to do whatever it
wants&per. It can say "Hello world", but it can also
choose to start a dozen subthreads with videos playing&per.

:p.
The disadvantage is that writing a PM window class from
scratch is a bit more difficult than using standard
controls&per. But that's why there are plenty of samples
to learn from&per. 
:p.
When a widget is created (either because it is added
to an open XCenter or when an XCenter is opened in the
first place and thus all widgets have to be created),
it does call :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WinCreateWindow:font facename=default size=0x0. with the PM window class
name that was specified with the widget class&per. So
this is really not too spectacular&per. 
.br
:li.
A :hp2."widget plugin DLL":ehp2. is a separate DLL which resides
in the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.plugins\xcenter:font facename=default size=0x0. directory of the XWorkplace installation
directory&per. This must contain one or several widget
classes&per. There are three procedures that a widget
plugin DLL is required to export to make the XCenter
see the widget classes&per. This is explained in detail
on the next pages&per.

which contains an absolute minimum widget without any
fancy functionality&per. All this widget does is display

At the very least, a plug-in DLL must do the following&colon.

:ol compact.:li.
It must :hp2.export three procedures:ehp2. by ordinal&per. :hp2.
:p.
a):ehp2. The :hp2."init":ehp2. export (ordinal 1) gets called once only
by the XCenter when your DLL gets loaded&per. The DLL
can get loaded in situations other than widget creation,
so do not expect this to always be the case&per. On
init, the DLL should register the widget's PM window
class (by calling :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WinRegisterClass:font facename=default size=0x0.)&per. In addition,
it can import functions from :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.XFLDR&per.DLL:font facename=default size=0x0., whose module
handle is given to it (this is optional)&per. However,
it must always return a pointer to the array of :link reftype=hd res=10144.:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.XCENTERWIDGETCLASS:font facename=default size=0x0.:elink.
structures in the DLL so that the XCenter knows about
the classes in the DLL&per. 
:p.
See :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.toolkit\miniwdgt&per.c:font facename=default size=0x0. for how this is done&per.
:hp2.
:p.
b):ehp2. The :hp2."uninit":ehp2. export (ordinal 2) gets called when
the DLL is unloaded by the XCenter&per. This can do
cleanup, if necessary&per. :hp2.
:p.
c):ehp2. The :hp2."query version":ehp2. export (ordinal 3) gets called
even before the "init" export to check the XWorkplace
version number that this widget requires&per. 
.br
:li.
The plug-in DLL must then contain a :hp2.PM window procedure:ehp2.
for the widget class&per. In the mini widget sample,
this is the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.fnwpSampleWidget:font facename=default size=0x0. procedure&per. The "Init"
export is reponsible for calling :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WinRegisterClass:font facename=default size=0x0. on
that window procedure to create a PM window class from
it&per. 
:p.
This is the usual switch/case stuff that is used with
every PM window procedure&per. There are a couple of
extra considerations to be made though, which are explained
below&per. 
.br
:li.
On :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WM_CREATE:font facename=default size=0x0., the widget :hp1.must:ehp1. store the :link reftype=hd res=10143.:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.XCENTERWIDGET:font facename=default size=0x0.:elink.
pointer it receives with :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.mp1:font facename=default size=0x0. in its :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.QWL_USER:font facename=default size=0x0. window
word&per. That's why the mini widget sample calls :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WinSetWindowPtr(hwnd,
QWL_USER, mp1);:font facename=default size=0x0. on WM_CREATE&per. 
.br
:li.
On :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WM_CONTROL:font facename=default size=0x0., it should handle notifications from the
XCenter&per. The XCenter will send :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WM_CONTROL:font facename=default size=0x0. messages
to the widget when it wants to know the widget's size,
for example&per. 
:p.
The notification codes that the XCenter uses with :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WM_CONTROL:font facename=default size=0x0.
are listed in :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.toolkit\center&per.h:font facename=default size=0x0.&per. There will probably
be more of them in the future&per. 
.br
:li.
Normally, with PM, all unprocessed messages are forwarded
to :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WinDefWindowProc:font facename=default size=0x0.&per. With widgets, this is different&colon.
you must always pass unprocessed messages to the "XCenter
default widget procedure", whose address is given to
your widget in the :link reftype=hd res=10143.:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.XCENTERWIDGET:font facename=default size=0x0.:elink. structure on :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WM_CREATE:font facename=default size=0x0.
in the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.pfnwpDefWidgetProc:font facename=default size=0x0. field&per. (Yes, this is the
reason why you must store that structure in your window
words&per.) 
:p.
If you do not pass unused messages on, you will severely
hurt the widget's functionality&per. Even worse, you
will cause memory leaks because the default widget procedure
is responsible for cleaning up resources and important
XCenter notifications&per. 
.br
:li.
Even if you do your own processing on :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WM_DESTROY:font facename=default size=0x0., you
must :hp1.always, always:ehp1. pass :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WM_DESTROY:font facename=default size=0x0. on to :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.pfnwpDefWidgetProc:font facename=default size=0x0.&per.
Otherwise the XCenter cannot clean up your widget's
resources properly&per. 
:eol.
:p.

.* Source file: "plug_52strings.html"
:h2 res=10137 x=right width=70%.Step 2: Supporting Setup Strings
:p.
OK, so your minimal widget from step 1 is running&per.

:p.
You probably have figured out already that even though
the minimal widget does react to fonts and colors dropped
on it, those fonts and colors are not saved when the
XCenter is closed and then re-opened&per. 
:p.
Similarly, if you changed the minimal widget to be sizeable
(by setting the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WGTF_SIZEABLE:font facename=default size=0x0. flag in the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.ulClassFlags:font facename=default size=0x0.
field of :link reftype=hd res=10144.:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.XCENTERWIDGETCLASS:font facename=default size=0x0.:elink., you will find out that
the widget's size will not be remembered either&per.

:p.
Of course, the XCenter could have implemented saving
these settings for your widget&per. But then, where
would your widget store additional data that the XCenter
would not know of? Using the profile functions to store
the widget data in :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.OS2&per.INI:font facename=default size=0x0. would not be a good idea
because there can be several instances of your widget,
which should all store their data independently&per.

:p.
As a result, I figured that storing widgets data together
with the data of the XCenter that the widget belongs
to would be the best idea&per. 
:p.
To make this most flexible and easy to use, the widgets
can have :hp2.setup strings:ehp2. associated with them&per. If
you look at the "Widgets" page in the properties notebook
of an XCenter, you will see that each widget can have
its own setup string to store any data it wants&per.

:p.
Even though the widgets are not Desktop objects themselves,
for simplicity, I chose to use the WPS setup string
format for the widgets also&per. That is, your widget
can understand, for example, a :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.BACKGROUNDCOLOR=00FF00;:font facename=default size=0x0.
setup string, which would set the widget's background
color to green&per. 
:p.
Your widget class must now implement two things&colon.

:ul compact.:li.
:hp2.Parse a setup string:ehp2. and convert it into binary data
that your widget can use&per. In the above example,
for the background color, you could say that the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.BACKGROUNDCOLOR:font facename=default size=0x0.
string would have to be followed by a six-digit RGB
hex value&per. The definition is up to your widget class&per.

.br
:li.
:hp2.Create a setup string:ehp2. from a set of binary values&per.
This is needed when the data of your widget is about
to be saved&per. 
:eul.
:p.
When your widget is created, it receives a previously
stored setup string in the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.pcszSetupString:font facename=default size=0x0. field of
its :link reftype=hd res=10143.:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.XCENTERWIDGET:font facename=default size=0x0.:elink. structure that comes with :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WM_CREATE:font facename=default size=0x0.&per.
You can then allocate your own structure and store it
in :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.XCENTERWIDGET&per.pUser:font facename=default size=0x0., parse the setup string,
and store the values in there&per. Of course, you should
set up safe defaults if a setup string is missing because
there won't be any when your widget is initially created
by the user&per. 
:p.
Reversely, when your widget's data has changed (e&per.g&per.
because a new background color has been dropped on it),
it should compose a new full setup string&per. After
the new setup string is composed, the widget must send
the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.XCM_SAVESETUP:font facename=default size=0x0. message to its parent window (which
is either the XCenter client or a tray widget window,
if the widget resides in a tray), which will cause the
new setup string to be stored together with the other
widget data in the XCenter's private data&per. See :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.center&per.h:font facename=default size=0x0.
for details&per. 
:p.
In order to encapsulate the setup string functionality,
I recommend that you create a new structure definition
for "saveable instance data"&per. This could, for example,
contain fields for background, foreground color, and
font to be used&per. For sizeable widgets, this could
also include the current size&per. 
:p.
This encapsulation allows your widget class to work
on setup strings with setup dialogs later also, which
can even be invoked when no instance of your widget
presently exists&per. 
:p.
The minimal sample has no provisions for setup strings&per.
Download the XWorkplace source code and look into the
:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.src\widgets:font facename=default size=0x0. directory, which has more examples for how
this works&per. :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.XFLDR&per.DLL:font facename=default size=0x0. also exports a couple
of handy functions that you can use to parse setup strings
more easily&per. 
.br

.* Source file: "plug_53tooltips.html"
:h2 res=10138 x=right width=70%.Step 3: Adding Tooltips
:p.
To make your widget support tooltips (fly-over help),
set the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WGTF_TOOLTIP:font facename=default size=0x0. flag in the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.ulClassFlags:font facename=default size=0x0. field
of :link reftype=hd res=10144.:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.XCENTERWIDGETCLASS:font facename=default size=0x0.:elink.&per. 
:p.
Only if that bit is set, your widget will receive a
:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WM_CONTROL:font facename=default size=0x0. message with the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.TTN_NEEDTEXT:font facename=default size=0x0. notification
and :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.XCENTER_TOOLTIP:font facename=default size=0x0. as the control's ID&per. 
:p.
You will need to include :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.include\helpers\comctl&per.h:font facename=default size=0x0.
from the XWorkplace helpers for the definitions of the
XWorkplace tooltip control&per. 
:p.
Again, if you have the full XWorkplace source code,
see the widgets in :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.src\widgets:font facename=default size=0x0. for how this is done&per.

.br

.* Source file: "plug_54imports.html"
:h2 res=10139 x=right width=70%.Step 4: Importing functions from XFLDR.DLL
:p.
As you might imagine, there is plenty of useful code
in :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.XFLDR&per.DLL:font facename=default size=0x0. -- for graphics, strings, PM controls,
and much more&per. Most of what you see in the "XWorkplace
helpers" sources is probably in :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.XFLDR&per.DLL:font facename=default size=0x0. somewhere&per.

:p.
Now, if you want to use that code, you basically have
two options&per. 
:ol compact.:li.
Copy and paste the functions from the helpers sources
(or wherever else from) into your widget code&per. 
.br
:li.
The smart way to do this however would be to avoid duplicate
code and use the code from :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.XFLDR&per.DLL:font facename=default size=0x0.&per. The XCenter
interfaces allow you to do exactly that&colon. 
:p.
When your DLL's "init" export gets called (ordinal 1),
it receives the module handle of :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.XFLDR&per.DLL:font facename=default size=0x0.&per.
You can then use :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.DosQueryProcAddr:font facename=default size=0x0. to resolve the addresses
of functions which are exported from :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.XFLDR&per.DLL:font facename=default size=0x0.,
store those function pointers in global variables, and
use them instead&per. 
:p.
Again, see the standard widgets in :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.src\widgets\:font facename=default size=0x0. in the
XWorkplace sources, which all make use of this feature&per.

:p.
To make sure the prototypes are correct, many prototypes
have already been typedef'd in the various XWorkplace
header files&per. Basically, I added a typedef whenever
I needed an export myself&per. Similarly, in :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.src\shared\xwp&per.def:font facename=default size=0x0.,
you will find those functions exported which I needed
for the standard plugins&per. If you need more functions
and prototypes, just contact me, and I'll add them&per.

:eol.
:p.

.* Source file: "plug_55dialog.html"
:h2 res=10140 x=right width=70%.Step 5: Settings Dialogs
:p.
Settings dialogs can be displayed by the XCenter to
further tune the instance data of a certain widget&per.
An example of a settings dialog is the "Filter" dialog
displayed by the standard "Window List" widget that
comes with XWorkplace&per. 
:p.
Using settings dialogs requires a bit more setup&per.
The most important thing to remember is that the XCenter
does :hp1.not:ehp1. invoke a settings dialog on an open XCenter
widget, but on a :hp1.setup string:ehp1. only&per. 
:p.
This was done so that settings dialogs can be displayed
for a widget even if that widget is not currently visible
(i&per.e&per. doesn't currently exist as a window)&per.
This allows the XCenter to display the settings dialog
from both the "Properties" menu item in a widget's context
menu and from a widget's context menu on the "Widgets"
page in the XCenter settings notebook -- even if the
XCenter isn't currently open&per. 
:p.
Basically, to support settings dialogs, your widget
class must do the following&colon. 
:ol compact.:li.
In the widget class definition (:link reftype=hd res=10144.:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.XCENTERWIDGETCLASS:font facename=default size=0x0.:elink.),
set the :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.pShowSettingsDlg:font facename=default size=0x0. field to the function in your
DLL which can display the settings dialog&per. 
:p.
This function must have the following prototype&colon.
:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.
:p.
typedef VOID EXPENTRY ShowSettingsDialog(PWIDGETSETTINGSDLGDATA
pData);:font facename=default size=0x0. 
.br
:li.
When the XCenter needs to invoke the settings dialog
(e&per.g&per. because the "Properties" menu item was
selected), it will call exactly this function, which
should do a standard :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WinDlgBox:font facename=default size=0x0. and not return until
the dialog has been dismissed ("OK" or "Cancel" were
pressed)&per. 
:p.
That function receives a pointer to a temporary :link reftype=hd res=10141.:font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WIDGETSETTINGSDLGDATA:font facename=default size=0x0.:elink.
structure, which the XCenter has composed for the settings
dialog&per. In there, the settings dialog can find out
whether the widget is currently visible&per. 
:eol.

:h2 res=10147 x=right width=70%.WPS Menu IDs
:p.
When using the WPObject setup string :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.MENUITEMSELECTED:font facename=default size=0x0.,
the following menu IDs might be useful to you&per. Please
keep in mind that not all of these are intended for
all kinds of objects; for example, "Format disk" does
not make sense on folders, and I don't know what will
happen if you try this out&per. If you're lucky, nothing
happens&per. 
:p.
Note that the new menu items introduced by XWorkplace
have no :hp1.fixed:ehp1. menu IDs, so they're not listed here&per.
Instead, the XWorkplace menu items have :hp1.variable:ehp1. menu
IDs, whose base is specified with the "XWorkplace menu
item ID offset" global setting&per. This base is added
to :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.WPMENUID_USER:font facename=default size=0x0., which is 0x6500 (25856 decimal), and
the XWorkplace menu ID's are then added to that base
to allow compatibility with other WPS enhancers&per.
So if you wish to use an XWorkplace menu item with :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.MENUITEMSELECTED:font facename=default size=0x0.,
you need some utility such as :font facename='Courier' size=18x12.XRAY:font facename=default size=0x0. to figure out the
"real" menu id&per. The ID will of course change again
if you change the offset setting&per.

The following WPS menu IDs are taken from the Warp 3
Toolkit docs (I have excluded those which make no sense
when called from REXX)&colon.

This section is supposed to explain the keys in the
