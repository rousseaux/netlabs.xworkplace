 * repclass.c:
 *      this file contains the REPCLASS utility for registering
 *      a new WPS class and replacing an existing class with it
 *      in one step. The command-line syntax is:
 *
 *          repclass <oldclass> <newclass> [<dllname>]
 *
 *      If <dllname> is specified, <newclass> is registered and
 *      replaces <oldclass>.
 *
 *      If <dllname> is omitted, the replacement of <oldclass>
 *      with <newclass> is undone and <newclass> is de-registered.
 *
 *      Initial release: Aug. 12, 1998
 *      Changed: 0.82. Made the output msgs a bit more lucid.
 *      This version: 0.9.0. Updated the startup message.
