Tools readme:

In order for the makefiles to work, copy these utilities
somewhere on your PATH.

---> Note: strrpl and html2ipf have bugs fixed with V0.84
     and V0.9.0.
     Please use the newer versions.
     html2ipf has been moved to 001/tools because it's
     really language-dependent.

BuildLevel.cmd (W) Roman Stangl has been added with V0.9.0
and is used to write build  level information into module
definition files.
See EDM/2 5/06 for details.

unlock.exe is used by the XFolder makefiles to unlock the XFolder
DLL currently locked by the WPS. This is taken from an old version
of the lxLite package.
This has been written by Andrew Pavel Zabolotny.

strrpl.exe has been written by me. It is for fast string search and
replace in files and useful for updating the INF HTML sources to
V0.83. This has been updated and bugfixed with V0.9.0.
Start the program to have it explain itself.
