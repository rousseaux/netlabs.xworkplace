<B>&xwp; 0.9.12 (June 3, 2001)</B>

<P>New features:

<UL><LI>Extended associations can now be imported/exported through an XML file.
<P><LI>XFolder: Added default folder view override to "View" page in "Workplace Shell"
to prevent inheriting the default view from the parent folder.
<P><LI>XFolder: Folder sorting was mostly rewritten. This now finally supports
non-default sort classes (e.g. in the trash can, which can finally be sorted now too).
Also added "Folders first" as an additional sort setting to be applied on top of
the standard criterion.
<P><LI>&xcenter;: added "lockup" to X-button menu.
<P><LI>XWPString: added setup string support.
<P><LI>General: XWP can now read extended BLDLEVEL information, as used by most
of the IBM networking software. Reworked the "Module" page in XWPProgramFile for
displaying additional data, if available. We also support NOSTUB executables now
(e.g. JFS.IFS).
<P><LI>General: Added "Fix class titles" feature to "&xwp; setup".
<P><LI>"OS/2 Kernel": Reworked network drivers, Paul Ratcliffe added new driver
descriptions.

</UL>Miscellaneous changes:

<UL><LI>General: Reworked trap logs a bit for more lucid output. Added seg:ofs translation of
trapping CS:EIP for each stack frame.
<P><LI>General: Sped up XFLDR.DLL loading by removing a lot of fixup relocation records.
<P><LI>Removed "Partitions" view from WPDrives, which never worked right.
<P><LI>Startup: completely rewrote the entire startup processing to use a separate
thread now. This should fix some of the problems on startup, like endlessly looping
startup folders, I hope. At least it makes the code much more readable.
<P><LI>Folder auto-refresh: reworked quite a bit, this now picks up file rename
too and refreshes the entire folder if an overflow occurred. Also fixed some
crashes and locks on the way.
<P><LI>Function keys: removed "Modifier" setting, since it did nothing in the first place.
<P><LI>&xcenter;: Winlist widget filters now match the first characters only.

</UL>Bugfixes:

<UL><LI>General: Added mutex protection to tooltips, which should fix some strange
problems. Also fixed some other minor problems.
<P><LI>General: Paul Ratcliffe fixed the ugly line break display in a number of
places.
<P><LI>General: Chart control (used on XFldDisk "Details" page)
caused huge PM resource leaks which could lead to system hangs. Fixed.
<P><LI>General: Fixed three minor memory leaks.
<P><LI>XFolder: Disabled "Cleanup INI files" for now. Did more harm than good.
<P><LI>XFolder: Replacement "File exists" dialog never populated the target folder,
which could lead to duplicate objects and even system hangs. Fixed.
<P><LI>XFolder: "Snap to grid" item on "XFolder" page didn't work. Fixed.
<P><LI>XFolder: Extended menu items in "View" pulldown broke somehow. Fixed.
<P><LI>XFldDisk: "Details" page always displayed 512 bytes for the sector size.
Fixed, this now _really_ displays the sector size.
<P><LI>Extended file types: Removing an association or type on program/file settings
notebook pages caused a trap. Fixed. Also fixed a small memory leak.
<P><LI>"Workplace Shell": "Undo" never really worked on the "Sort" page. Fixed.
<P><LI>"OS/2 Kernel": "Drivers" page frequently displayed garbage for the driver
info. Fixed.
<P><LI>"OS/2 Kernel": HPFS and HPFS386 dialogs crashed if no parameters existed
in &cfgsys;. Fixed, thanks Lars Erdmann.
<P><LI>"OS/2 Kernel": HPFS386 dialog displayed nothing if HPFS386.INI wasn't explicitly
given on the IFS line in &cfgsys;. Fixed.
<P><LI>"OS/2 Kernel": Fixed another quirk in the &cfgsys; routines which caused
the wrong line to be replaced in rare cases.
<P><LI>Trash can wasn't very good at setting meaningful drive support defaults. Fixed;
per default drives are supported only if they are FAT, HPFS, JFS, or FAT32.
<P><LI>&xcenter;: Added mutex protection to the internal timers to prevent some
race conditions.
<P><LI>&xcenter;: Winlist widget now shows hidden windows on click.
<P><LI>&xcenter;: Winlist widget filter changes weren't picked up any longer since
the changes in 0.9.11. Fixed.
<P><LI>&xcenter;: Pulse widget didn't update display if some app occupied the SIQ.
Fixed; a separate thread now gets the performance data from OS/2 kernel.
<P><LI>&xcenter;: Trapped sometimes when several threads attempted to load the
widget classes. Fixed, added mutex protection to DLL loading.
<P><LI>&xcenter;: Added extra checks for view creation/destruction.
<P><LI>&xcenter;: Fixed crash in tmrTimerTick when animations were enabled.
<P><LI>&xcenter;: Hopefully fixed hang on XShutdown.
<P><LI>&xcenter;: X-Button started shutdown/restart Desktop etc. on &xcenter; thread. Fixed,
now started on thread 1.
<P><LI>&pgr;: reworked internal mutex handling some. This seems to fix some of
the strange PM hangs that occurred sporadically.
<P><LI>Hook: Martin Lafaix fixed the new sliding menus mechanism introduced with
V0.9.11. Pulldowns are no longer delayed, and all submenu selections should be
properly processed now (except for some Netscape submenus, but that's a minor annoyance).
<P><LI>XShutdown: Animations frequently didn't show. Fixed.
<P><LI>XShutdown: Now recovering all windows from other desktops to screen before
closing windows.
<P><LI>XShutdown: Fixed shutdown folder which never waited for objects to close.
