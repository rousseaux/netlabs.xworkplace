    /*
     *@@ XCENTERWIDGET:
     *      public structure to hold data for an &xcenter;
     *      widget, i.e. a PM window in the &xcenter; client
     *      area.
     *
     *      Each &xcenter; widget is a separate window,
     *      being a child window of the &xcenter; client,
     *      which in turn is a child of the &xcenter; frame.
     *
     *      This structure is created once for each widget
     *      and passed to each widget in mp1 of WM_CREATE.
     *      The first thing a widget must do on WM_CREATE
     *      is to store a pointer to this structure in its
     *      QWL_USER window word.
     *
     *      The widget can allocate another widget-specific
     *      buffer and store its pointer into the pUser
     *      field.
     *
     *      This structure is automatically freed by the
     *      &xcenter; when the widget is destroyed. However,
     *      if you allocated more memory for pUser, it is
     *      your own responsibility to free that on WM_DESTROY.
     *      General rule: The widget must clean up what it
     *      allocated itself.
