REMARK from Ulrich M”ller 2002-12-14:

I screwed up checking in the 046 tree correctly into CVS and had to
give it a second try, since I was unable to figure out what really
went wrong. This is why the Swedish tree is "046_" (note the underscore).

Sorry about that.

The main make has been updated so that "nmake 046" should still work
correctly from the root.
