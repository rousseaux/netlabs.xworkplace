2. INTRODUCTION
===============

    Welcome to the XWorkplace 1.0 source code branch.

    Since XWorkplace is a fairly complex beast, I have tried to add
    plenty of documentation, most of which is contained in the
    PROGREF.INF file in the main directory of the source tree.

    In order to get to know XWorkplace's structure, you might first
    want to read the "XWorkplace Internals" section in the XWorkplace
    User Guide, which comes with the binary distribution already.

    The README that is used for the latest _binary_ release is in the
    "001\readme" file.

    --> NOTE: If you got this from CVS, you have checked out the
        XWorkplace 1.0.x branch. This has a few complications:

        1)  You must make sure that the "xwphelpers" repository
            is the 1.0.x branch as well, or XWorkplace won't compile.

        2)  CVS remembers that you checked out the branch and
            will keep checking out from the branch, unless you
            explicitly tell it to switch. See the CVS documentation
            for details, or delete the entire tree and check out
            from scratch again.


3. COMPILATION/INSTALLATION
===========================

    See PROGREF.INF for detailed instructions.

    NOTE: The build process has been changed with V0.9.12.
    PROGREF.INF has been updated to reflect these changes.

    Essentially, if you managed to build XWP before, you
    need to

    1)  take a look at the new "config.in" file and adjust it to
        match your system (this replaces the environment
        variables which were necessary previously);

    2)  run "nmake dep" once to create .depend files in the
        subdirectories;

    3)  run "nmake really_all" to build the whole system. As
        opposed to plain "nmake", this builds the NLS and a
        few extra programs too.
