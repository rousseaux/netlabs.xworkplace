<BODY>
This describes the commands on the xfix <B>Popup menu</B> and its keyboard
shortcuts 
(see <A HREF="xfix_menus.html">Menubar Commands</A> for a description of
options available on the main menubar).

<P><B>Popup Menu</B>

<UL><LI><B>Move abstracts to desktop</B> moves non-file objects assigned to this
folder to the &link_desktop;.  They will appear there after the WPS is restarted.
This menu item is only available when a single handle is selected --
you can not move objects from multiple folders at once.

<P>Use this option before deleting a handle that displays
<CODE>Abstract objects</CODE> in the "References" column.  Otherwise, these
objects will be deleted along with the handle.

<P><LI><B>Remove folder positions</B> deletes the <CODE>OS2.INI</CODE> entry
that stores the size and position of folder windows and of WPS Properties notebooks.
It is always safe to delete these entries because they are not critical. At worst,
you will have to resize or reposition the window when you next open it.

<P><LI><B>Remove object ID</B> deletes the text-based identifier associated with
this object.  Object IDs are used by programs and REXX scripts to locate an object
without having to know its exact name or location.  These entries should probably
not be deleted unless you know for certain that they are unneeded.

<P><LI><B>Delete</B> marks a handle <IMG SRC="img/xfix_delete.gif"> for deletion.
The actual deletion won't happen until you choose either "Delete now.." from the
"Actions" menu or "Write back to OS2SYS.INI..." from the "xfix" menu.

<P>If deleting a handle would cause other handles to become <B>orphans</B>
(invalid because you've deleted their parent's handle), the affected handles
will be marked <IMG SRC="img/xfix_orphan.gif"> and the Status column will display
<B>"Possible orphan"</B>.  Unless you plan to delete the orphans, you should
definitely undelete the handle which caused this warning to appear.

<P>Note: when a handle that is marked <IMG SRC="img/xfix_error.gif"> invalid
or <IMG SRC="img/xfix_orphan.gif"> orphaned is deleted, the count of invalid
or orphaned items in the status bar is decreased.  For orphans, the error
description in the Status column is also removed.

<P><LI><B>Undelete</B> removes the <IMG SRC="img/xfix_delete.gif"> from a
handle so it won't be deleted.  If the handle was previously marked as
<IMG SRC="img/xfix_error.gif"> invalid or <IMG SRC="img/xfix_orphan.gif">
orphaned, those icons will be restored and the error description will
reappear in the Status column.

<P><LI><B>Protect</B> marks a handle <IMG SRC="img/xfix_protect.gif"> so
it can't be deleted by accident.  The handles for all of the folders on
the protected object's path are marked <IMG SRC="img/xfix_safe.gif"> so
they are safe from deletion as well.  Attempts to delete any of these handles
will be ignored.  If they are already marked <IMG SRC="img/xfix_delete.gif">
for deletion, they will be undeleted. Handles that are marked
<IMG SRC="img/xfix_error.gif"> invalid can not be protected.

<P>Note: you can use "Auto-protect" on the "Actions" menu to automatically
protect all of the most important handles.  Doing so will prevent errors
that could destroy your Desktop.  See
<A HREF="xfix_menus.html">Menubar Commands</A> for more details,

<P><LI><B>Unprotect</B> removes the <IMG SRC="img/xfix_protect.gif">
from the protected handle.  The <IMG SRC="img/xfix_safe.gif"> assigned
to folders on the protected handle's path will also be removed if no
other protected handle relies on them.

<P>Note: handles that are marked <IMG SRC="img/xfix_safe.gif"> can not
be unprotected directly.  You must unprotect the handle that caused them
to become safe from deletion (the one marked <IMG SRC="img/xfix_protect.gif">),
Since several protected handles may have a particular folder in their path,
you will have to unprotect all of them.  You can use "Unprotect all" on the
"Actions" menu to remove protection from every handle.

<P><B>Hot Keys</B>

<P>Unlike the corresponding menu items, these keyboard shortcuts toggle the setting:
from off to on, and then back to off.

<UL><LI><B>Delete</B> - <CODE>Delete</CODE> key or <CODE>Ctrl+D</CODE>

<P><LI><B>Protect</B> - <CODE>Ctrl+P</CODE>
</UL>
