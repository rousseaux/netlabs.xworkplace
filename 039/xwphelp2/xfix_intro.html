<!-- revised V1.0.9 -->
<BODY>
This is <B>xfix</B>, the &xwp; File Handles Fixer.

<P><B>Overview</B>

<P>xfix allows you to:

<UL><LI>view the contents of the WPS's file handle data blocks from the
<CODE>OS2SYS.INI</CODE> files in a PM window.

<LI>remove handles that are no longer needed because the file
or folder it refers to no longer exists.

<LI>remove handles for existing files and folders that aren't needed
because the WPS doesn't use them (for instance, handles for DLLs or
ZIP files).

<LI>remove folder position entries that aren't needed.

<LI>move lost abstract objects such as Program Objects and Shadows
to the Desktop.
</UL>

Compared to Henk Kelder's formidable CHECKINI program (from the
<A HREF="http://www.os2site.com/sw/util/wps/wptools33.zip">WPTOOLS</A> package),
xfix gives you more control, but also requires more attention and knowledge.
Thanks go out to Henk Kelder again for finding out how the handles work in
the first place. xfix is partly based on his work.

<P><B>Warning</B>

<P>This program allows you to remove file handles that the WPS relies
on, such as the handle for the Desktop. xfix contains features such
as Auto-Protect to help prevent you from making catastrophic errors
but it is still possible to make changes that should not be made.

<P>Your system will not be modified until you save your work by
selecting "xfix-&gt;Write back to OS2SYS.INI" from the main menu.
Feel free to examine xfix's info and options but <B>don't save
anything until you know what you're doing.</B> Read through the
following before using it.

<P><B>Commandline Options</B>

<P>By default, xfix uses the copies of <CODE>OS2.INI</CODE> and
<CODE>OS2SYS.INI</CODE> that are currently in use by your system.
However, you can tell it to use other copies of these files instead.
To do so, use the <CODE><B>-U</B></CODE> and <CODE><B>-S</B></CODE>
options.  The letters must be uppercase and the filename must
follow the letter with no space in between.  In almost every situation,
you should use both options:

<UL>
<BR><LI><CODE><B>-Ufilename</B></CODE> -- this is the "user" INI,
normally <CODE>OS2.INI</CODE>
<BR>for example: <CODE>-Uc:\os2\myos2,ini</CODE>

<BR><LI><CODE><B>-Sfilename</B></CODE> -- this is the "system" INI,
normally <CODE>OS2SYS.INI</CODE>
<BR>for example: <CODE>-Uc:\os2\myos2sys,ini</CODE>
</UL>

Here is a complete example:
<BR><CODE>xfix -Uc:\os2\os2.ini-test -Sc:\os2\os2sys.ini-test</CODE>
