<P>All changes listed below are the product of Rich Walsh.

<P><B>Changes:</B>

<UL><LI><B>Xview:</B> splitview has been enhanced and renamed Xview. Among the new
features available are:
<UL>
<LI>a new details view mode to complement the existing icon view
<LI>menu-accessible view options that are specific to Xview
<LI>the ability to set Xview as the system default folder view
</UL>
In addition, several pre-existing bugs in splitview have been fixed.

<P><LI><B>NLS Packaging:</B> for each supported language (DE/EN/IT/JA/NL) the
XWP build system now creates a complete package with all needed components.
It is no longer necessary for users to install a base package and then
another package that supports their language.

<P><LI><B>Build System Customization:</B> the XWP build system has been
extensively revised to permit builders to create their own customized
"full" and "lite" builds of XWP without making any changes to the source code.
Full details of these changes along with how-to instructions can be found in
"buildme.xwp" and "ecs\buildme.ecs" located within the XWP source tree.
