<B>&xwp; 0.9.2 (March 24, 2000)</B>
<P>New features:
<UL><LI>Incorporated "&pgr;", virtual desktops.
<P><LI>Automatic menu selection, even with configurable delay for submenus (as in Win95).
Added second "Movement" page to "Mouse" object for this.
<P><LI>New "Screen" settings object, which has those "System" settings pages dealing
with the screen. The "Screen" page from "OS/2 Kernel" has been moved to that object now.
<P><LI>Added "Syslevel" page to "OS/2 Kernel".
<P><LI>Trash can now automatically calculates the total size if a folder has been deleted,
including subdirectories.
<P><LI>Added meaningful file operations error messages. Drives support is finally
respected for deleting objects to the trash can.
<P><LI>XSHUTDWN.EXE has been added again. Seems to work.
<P><LI>Added "delay" setting for APM power off to "&xshutdown;" page.
<P><LI>Added hotkey description display in context menus.

</UL>Miscellaneous changes:
<UL><LI>"Shutdown" menu item now has the "d" shortcut, which doesn't conflict with
"Properties".
<P><LI>Further optimized hook logic for speed.
<P><LI>Changed all &xwp; object IDs to start with &lt;XWP_xxx&gt; to avoid conflicts
with old XFolder versions.
<P><LI>The configuration folder is no longer automatically created at startup because
this lead to problems on some systems. Use the "Objects" page in "&xwp; setup"
to create it manually.
<P><LI>Updated the "&xwp;" sub-config folder a bit.
<P><LI>&xwp; settings objects had a "Create another" menu item, which doesn't make
sense. Removed that.
<P><LI>Rearranged controls on "File" page a bit.
<P><LI>Added "?:\xwplog.log" file for &xwp; warnings. If this file exists, you
might have a problem.
<P><LI>Increased stack space for all additional &xwp; threads.
<P><LI>Removed context-sensitive help upon pressing F1 on some notebook pages.
Now we'll always show the help for the entire page first.

</UL>Bugfixes:
<UL><LI>Warp 3 detection didn't work, leading to wrong default settings and messy
dialogs when &xwp; was run under Warp 3. Fixed.
<P><LI>Fixed a minor notebook mutex error.
<P><LI>"Archive" status window was displayed even if this was turned off. Fixed.
<P><LI>"Subject" field on first "File" page was limited to 36 characters. Changed this
to 260, even though the IBM docs say this isn't so. Thanks, Mike Reichel, for counting
the characters.
<P><LI>Added thread-safety checks to internal folder contents enumerations.
<P><LI>With folders, "Object" page would appear between the two "Icon" pages. Fixed.
<P><LI>Using work area folders would lock the WPS hard when objects in the folder were
re-opened. Fixed.
<P><LI>Removed static view field from folder view structure (SUBCLASSEDLISTITEM).
Now rechecking folder view every time this is needed because this might change.
<P><LI>Deleting the configuration folder would take to a lot of WPS-internal crashes
the next time a folder context menu was opened. Fixed.
<P><LI>Drives were checked for readiness even if "Replace drive not ready dlg" was
disabled. Fixed. If a drive cannot be opened now, disable that setting.
<P><LI>There was a heap allocation error with the XWPSetup object on object creation,
sometimes leading to system hangs. Fixed.
<P><LI>"Features" page "Undo" and "Default" buttons created duplicate records. Fixed.
<P><LI>XFldDisk and XFldShutdown items were checked in the "&xwp; classes" dlg
even if those classes were not installed. Fixed.
<P><LI>Automatically creating the trashcan via "Features" works now.
<P><LI>The trash can now displays the "File exists" dialog correctly when a file exists
in the trash can already.
<P><LI>Converting settings from XFolder led to some problems. Fixed.
<P><LI>Menu buttons (e.g. the "Partitions" button) displayed a menu even if disabled. Fixed.
<P><LI>The bitmap which was created with the "Details" chart was never freed (baaaad
PM resource leak). Fixed.
<P><LI>The "Auto-hide mouse pointer" checkbox on the "Mouse movement" page wasn't
working. Another (static) control on the page had the same dialog item ID. %$õ%!, I hate
that. Took me half an hour to figure out.
<P><LI>Mouse-button-3 scrolling didn't work horizontally when vertical scroll bar was disabled in a window. Fixed.
<P><LI>Fixed Netscape hangs with MB3 scrolling when the scroller changed while being
scrolled.
<P><LI>Fixed some other minor quirks with MB3 scrolling.
<P><LI>Many hook features were triggered even though the mouse was currently captured by an application
or the system. This could lead to severe system hangs, especially with "show window list everywhere".
Fixed.
<P><LI>"Hot corners" desktop menu sometimes conflicted with "sliding focus" because
the focus was immediately given back to the window under the mouse. Fixed.
