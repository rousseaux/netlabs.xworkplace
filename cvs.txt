1. INTRODUCTION TO CVS
======================

    CVS stands for "Concurrent Versioning System". It is a tool
    which allows several developers to work on the same source code
    at the same time.

    Netlabs has set up a CVS server on which all the Netlabs projects
    reside. The concept of a client/server CVS setup is that the
    server maintains a "repository" with the entire source code,
    including all changes that were ever made. Each developer then
    creates a local copy of the sources on his hard disk. So each
    developer can safely work on the local sources until he thinks
    that everyone else should get the changes (once they're halfway
    stable), and can then put the changes on the server, and all
    other developers can then update their local copy.

    While your local copy will always be at a certain code/revision
    level, the server maintains all changes that were ever made.
    You can, for example, even retrieve the sources as they were in
    the middle of 1999, if you want.

    Maybe the nicest thing about CVS is that it will merge code changes.
    CVS has GNU "diff" built in so even if two people work on the
    same source file, CVS in most cases can automatically keep the
    changes in sync. See "Terminology" below.


2. WHICH CVS VERSION TO USE
===========================

    CVS is a Unix program that was ported to OS/2. There are several
    CVS versions on Hobbes. I strongly recommend to use 1.10.6,
    which is the most bug-free of them all. While 1.10 might still
    work OK, 1.10.7 causes tons of problems. Do not use it.


3. SETUP
========

    You can use the Netlabs Open Source Archive Client (NOSAC)
    instead of running CVS from the command line. However, I have
    found the command line much more practical, so I am going to
    explain the basics here. Please refer to the CVS documentation
    for details.

    As with most Unix programs, CVS expects you to have a "home"
    directory. If you don't have one, create an empty directory
    somewhere and set the HOME environment variable to that directory.

    In any case, I strongly recommend to create a file in $(HOME)
    called ".cvsrc" and add put a single line

        cvs -z9

    in there to enable maximum compression during transfers. This
    greatly speeds up things if you have a slow internet connection.

    Secondly, the most practical way to use CVS is to have a common
    parent directory for all code repositories (i.e. projects). So
    create one (for example, "F:\cvs"), which will become the parent
    directory for all CVS projects (e.g. "F:\cvs\xworkplace",
    "F:\cvs\warpin", "F:\cvs\xwphelpers").

    Finally, CVS needs you to have a user name and a password. If you
    don't have one yet, use "guest" and "readonly", which will give
    you read-only access to all Netlabs projects.

    Set the current project environment. This is done via another
    environment variable, so for XWorkplace, set:

        CVSROOT=:pserver:guest@www.netlabs.org:e:/netlabs.cvs/xworkplace

    For WarpIN, use:

        CVSROOT=:pserver:guest@www.netlabs.org:e:/netlabs.cvs/warpin

    For the "XWorkplace helpers", which are needed by both XWorkplace
    and WarpIN, use:

        CVSROOT=:pserver:guest@www.netlabs.org:e:/netlabs.cvs/xwphelpers

    and so on. Currently, Netlabs holds over a dozen projects which
    can all be retrieved that way.

    --> NOTE: The IP address of Netlabs has changed in December of 2000.
        If CVS refuses to connect, in the above, replace "www.netlabs.org"
        with "213.68.43.15", or add the following line to your HOSTS file
        in \MPTN\ETC:

            213.68.43.15          www.netlabs.org

        The new IP address should be updated in the domain name servers
        shortly.

    Create a local subdirectory in your CVS root directory with the
    same name (e.g. ("F:\cvs\xworkplace"). Change to that directory.

    Set USER=guest in your environment. Fire up your internet connection.
    To log onto a project, use the "cvs logon" command. Enter "readonly"
    when you are prompted for the password. (Note that you will need to
    enter "cvs logon" separately for each repository. CVS will then store
    the data in $(HOME) so you only need to do this once per project.)

    You are now ready to download ("check out") a project. See section
    5 below.


4. CVS TERMINOLOGY
==================

    The following terms should be known when working with CVS (or
    even reading the documentation):

    -- "Repository" is the unit CVS uses for managing projects.
       For example, "xworkplace", "warpin", and "xwphelpers" are
       three repositories on the Netlabs CVS server. Repositories
       are mirrored locally in a subdirectory of your CVS root
       directory, if you followed the above setup.

    -- "Checkout": You create a local copy of a repository when you
       check out the code.

       To check out code, use the "cvs checkout" command. Details
       follow in the next section.

    -- "Commit": If you have write access to the CVS server (which
       requires that you have been given a user name and password
       by the Netlabs admin, Adrian Gschwend), you can change the
       repository by "committing" your local copy back onto the
       server. Once the code has been committed, all other developers
       can check it out again and will have the updates.

       To commit code to the server, use the "cvs commit" command.
       See the CVS reference for details. Again, this requires that
       you have been granted write access.

    -- "Merge": This can happen if you already have checked out your
       local copy of a repository already and do another "checkout"
       later. If CVS then finds that a file has been changed on the
       server and your local copy needs to be updated, it "merges" all
       changes into the local copy. That is, it does not simply
       overwrite the local copy with the new version on the server,
       but will compare (diff) the two files and patch the local
       copy! CVS has GNU "diff" built in, so this is pretty powerful.

       This happens automatically if you do "cvs checkout" after
       your initial checkout. Note that you can also use
       "cvs update"; the difference is that "update" will not
       retrieve new files, but only update existing local files.
       See the CVS reference for details.

    -- "Conflicts": This happens if CVS cannot successfully merge
       changes into your local copy. Most frequently, this occurs
       when two developers have modified the same lines in the
       same source file. Of course, CVS cannot resolve these
       conflicts by itself, so it will put two versions into the
       file marked with special characters. (With C files, this
       will cause compilation to fail, which is intentional so
       that you have to manually resolve the conflict.)

       See the CVS reference for details.

5. CHECKING OUT THE CODE
========================

    Change to the XWorkplace root directory (e.g. "F:\cvs\xworkplace")
    set the XWorkplace environment as described above (HOME, USER,
    CVSROOT), and log on if you haven't logged on yet.

    The command for getting source from the server is "cvs checkout".
    With checkout, you need to specify the module to check out. For
    now, we will consider a module a directory name. Note that CVS
    normally operates on directories recursively! So if you use

        cvs checkout .

    (mind the dot) from the XWorkplace root directory, this will
    retrieve the entire code tree and create new local files if
    they don't exist yet. This can take a while for bigger projects.
    Again, use maximum compression (see section 3).

    By contrast, "cvs update" only updates local files which have
    been changed on the server. It does not create new files.
    Since I frequently create new files on the server, using
    "checkout" will probably be the better general choice.

    Note that to compile XWorkplace, you will also need the
    "XWorkplace Helpers" code, which is in a separate repository
    called "xwphelpers". So create a new empty project directory
    (e.g. "F:\cvs\xwphelpers"), change CVSROOT to point to the
    "xwphelpers" repository, change to the new directory, and
    do a "cvs checkout ." again.

    You will see that CVS puts out lots of information about the
    files that were worked on. A typical CVS output from "update"
    or "checkout" looks like this:

        ? doc/progref.ipf
        M makefile
        M include/build.h
        M include/filesys/program.h
        M src/classes/xcenter.c

    I strongly recommend redirecting standard output when using
    "cvs update" or "checkout" so you know what CVS has done,
    since these lines scroll of the screen very quickly. You
    can simply use "cvs checkout . > checkout.log" or something
    like that.

    The first letter tells you what CVS has done to the file:

        ?: CVS does not know the file. It is in your local tree,
           but not in the repository.
           This happens if you have added files to your local copy
           yourself.

        U: This is the most frequent one. It means that CVS has
           "U"pdated a local file with a new copy from the server
           and occurs during "checkout" or "update".

        P: Similar to "U", except that the server has only sent
           a "P"atch instead of the entire file. The result isn't
           any different from "U"; the file has been updated.

        M: This means that your local file was "M"odified before the
           update. You get this no matter if the file was updated
           (i.e. changes were merged successfully) or not.

        C: This happens if merge failed and a "C"onflict occured.
           You need to manually edit all files which have been
           marked with "C"; if they are C source files, they will
           no longer compile.

        R: A local file has been removed because it is no longer
           in the repository.
