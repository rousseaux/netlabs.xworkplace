
General Notes
=============

The following files change with practically every XWorkplace
version:

--  in /001/inf.001:
    notices_41thanks.html
    notices_42credits.html
    vers_2history.html

    Since I do not add version information to those files,
    I therefore do not recommend translating those. Simply
    always use the current English original.

For all other source files for the HLP and INF files, I try
to always add HTML comments ("<!-- ... -->") to signal what
has changed in a source file. I recommend having some "grep"
utility handy to be able to search for strings like "V0.9.0".
\OS2\APPS\PMSEEK.EXE should do also.


Changes for V0.9.6
==================

    --  ID_XSD_FILETYPES modified.
    --  ID_XSD_NEWFILETYPE modified.

    --  ID_XTD_SETTINGS modified.


Changes between V0.9.0 and V0.9.3
=================================

    Sorry, I have lost track about the changes in the dialog
    resources. I guess more than 70% of the dialogs have
    changed since XFolder 0.85, so it really doesn't make
    much sense tracking the changes here for XWorkplace.


Changes for V0.9.0
==================

    As the version number implies, this version is totally
    incompatible with older NLS files, because many new dialog
    resources have been added and others have changed.

    I have held back all NLS changes so far to make the XFolder
    0.8x NLS files compatible amongst each other. As a payback,
    you get the complete mess this time. ;-)

    I'm not sure whether the below information really helps
    if you have already done a translation for XFolder 0.8x,
    since so much has changed and I might have lost track
    about one or two dialog resources. Decide for yourself
    whether you prefer to follow those notes or do a complete
    re-translation.

    xfldr001.rc:
        all changes are marked in the file directly.

    xfldr001.dlg:
        Again, unfortunately, there are no comments in the .DLG
        file, because the damn thing is rewritten by IBM's dialog
        editor (which I'm using) all the time. In order to update
        your existing .DLG file, do the following:

        1) Remove the following dlg templates:

           -- ID_XSD_SET1XFOLDER ("XFolder")
           -- ID_XSD_SET5INTERNALS ("XFolder Internals")
           -- ID_XSD_SETTINGS_DTP1 (page 1 of "XDesktop")
           -- ID_XSD_SETTINGS_DTP2 (page 2 of "XDesktop")
           -- ID_XSD_SETTINGS_WPSCLASSES ("WPS Classes")
           -- ID_XSD_SELECTCLASS ("WPS Classes")
           -- ID_XSD_SETTINGS_WPSCL_REGISTER ("WPS Classes")
           -- ID_XSD_SETTINGS_WPSCL_INFO ("WPS Classes")
           -- ID_XSD_SETTINGS_FILEOPS ("File operations")

        2) Copy the following _new_ dlg templates from the new
           .DLG file into your existing one and translate them:

           -- ID_OSD_SETTINGS_SYSPATHS  (for OS/2 Kernel)
           -- ID_OSD_SETTINGS_STORAGE   (for OS/2 Kernel)

           -- ID_XCD_STATUS             (for XWPSetup)
           -- ID_XCD_PARANOIA           (for XWPSetup)
           -- ID_XCD_FEATURES           (for XWPSetup)
           -- ID_XCD_XWPINSTALLEDCLASSES (for XWPSetup)
           -- ID_XCD_FILEOPS            ("File operations" in XWPSetup)

           -- ID_XSD_DTP_SHUTDOWN       (for XFldDesktop)
           -- ID_XSD_DTP_STARTUP        (for XFldDesktop)
           -- ID_XSD_DTP_ARCHIVES       ("Archives" replacement page)
           -- ID_XSD_DTP_MENUITEMS      ("Menu items" page in XFldDesktop)

           -- ID_XSD_STARTUPFOLDER      (for XFldStartup)

           -- ID_XLD_CLASSLIST          (for XWPClassList)
           -- ID_XLD_CLASSINFO          (for XWPClassList)
           -- ID_XLD_METHODINFO         (for XWPClassList)
           -- ID_XLD_SELECTCLASS        (generic "select class" dlg)
           -- ID_XLD_REGISTERCLASS      ("Register class" dlg)
           -- ID_XLD_SETTINGS           (XWPClassList settings page)

           -- ID_XSD_FOLDERVIEWS        ("View" page in XFldWPS)
           -- ID_XSD_FILETYPES          ("File types" page in XFldWPS)
           -- ID_XSD_NEWFILETYPE        ("New file type" dlg)
           -- ID_XSD_NEWFILTER          ("New filter" dlg)
           -- ID_XSD_IMPORTWPS          ("Import WPS filters" dlg)
           -- ID_XSD_FILESPAGE          ("File" replacement page)
           -- ID_XSD_DISK_DETAILS       (WPDisk "Details" replacement page)
           -- ID_XSD_PROG_DETAILS       (WPProgramFile "Details" page)

           -- ID_XSD_XWPSOUND           (WPSound "Sounds" replacement page)
           -- ID_XSD_NEWSOUNDSCHEME     ("New Sound Scheme" dlg)

           -- ID_XTD_SETTINGS           (XWPTrashCan settings)

           -- ID_TSD_MAIN               (Treesize)
           -- ID_TSD_PRODINFO           (Treesize)

           -- ID_XFD_STARTUPPANIC       ("Startup panic" dlg)

           -- ID_XFD_ARCHIVINGSTATUS    (Archiver status window at WPS bootup)

           -- ID_XSD_KEYB_OBJHOTKEYS    ("Object hotkeys" page in XWPKeyboard)

        3) CHANGE the following:
           -- in ID_XSD_SETTINGS_FLDRSORT, remove the
              ID_XSDI_REPLACESORT checkbox completely
           -- in ID_XSD_REBOOTEXT, update ID_XSDI_XRB_ITEMNAME
              and add ID_XSDI_XRB_PARTITIONS
           -- All the "OS/2 Kernel" settings pages now have
              ID_OS* IDs (instead of ID_XF*) to tell them apart
              more easily.
           -- ID_XFD_TITLECLASH: items have been rearranged,
                and "KB" has been changed to "bytes".

        4) The following have been completely redesigned:
           -- ID_XFD_SELECTSOME         ("Select by name" dlg)
           -- ID_SDD_CONFIRM            (XShutdown confirmation dlg)
           -- ID_XSD_OBJECTDETAILS      (was object "Internals" page,
                                         now called "Object" page)

    xfldr001.hlp/inf:
        Please do a global search-and-replace over all help pages
        to replace "XFolder Online Reference" with "XWorkplace User Guide".
        These changes are not specifically marked.

        Other than that, many help panels have been updated because
        they contained outdated information. All those changes are
        marked, so search for "V0.9.0" to find these items.

        Lots of pages have been added also. This is marked in the
        sources also.

    /TOOLS
    ------

        has been updated again. Don't forget to copy all those files
        onto your PATH before using MAKE.CMD. See the "Programming
        Guide" for details.

    /HELPERS, /MAIN
    ---------------

        Yet again rearranged a lot of source code. In /helpers/, we
        have some new files (cnrh.*, comctl.*, debug.*, except.*,
        syssound.*, tmsgfile.*, wpsh.*) which are partly all new
        and partly composed of code which was in /MAIN before.
        See the file introductions for details.


Changes for V0.85
=================

    xfldr001.inf:
        not too many changes this time, except for the
        new documentation of WPS boot logos.
        As always, "grep" the new INF.001 directory for
        "V0.85" strings, which should lead you to the
        separate paragraphs which might have changed.

    instl001.cmd: fixed a bug in line 49/50.


Changes for V0.84
=================

    National Language Support
    -------------------------

    I have converted the various information in the NLS.TXT
    and README.TXT files into a proper INF book and updated
    lots of stuff. Please read through that thing and check
    what's new.

    Note: The files in /TOOLS have been partly updated.
          Please use the newer versions.
          HTML2IPF has been moved into a separate directory
          in /001/TOOLS so that I can keep the different
          NLS versions that you have created apart. The
          makefiles in /INF.001 and HELP.001 have been
          updated accordingly. The HTML2IPF environment
          variable is no longer needed.

    xfldr001.rc:
        I have removed the xfldr1.ico and xfldr2.ico files.
        Since the corresponding dlg id's are no longer defined
        in dlgids.h, please remove the following two lines from
        the top of xfldr001.rc:
            POINTER ID_ICON1 LOADONCALL MOVEABLE DISCARDABLE xfldr1.ico
            POINTER ID_ICON2 LOADONCALL MOVEABLE DISCARDABLE xfldr2.ico
        or you'll get errors from the resource compiler.

    xfldr001.inf:
        As always, do a global search in the new INF.001
        directory for "V0.84" strings, which should
        lead you to the separate paragraphs which
        might have changed. As always, I have marked
        the changed items with HTML comments. You can
        then update your translation.
        Additional remarks can be found in the HTML
        source files themselves.

        Be aware that I've rearranged all the status bar
        pages, because all the codes on that one page
        were hard to overlook. The text really hasn't
        changed much, except for two panels.
        Do the following:
        1)  copy and execute /001/ren084.cmd, which will rename
            a couple of files and update links;
        2)  remove the links as specified in 0632intro_folders.html;
        3)  copy the new 0632intro_statbars.html to your translation
            directory and update the "root" file (xfldr001.html);
        4)  copy all the new stat_*.html files to your translation
            directory; for the two files which are reported to exist
            already, choose "rename existing" (if you're using the
            XFolder replacement dialog);
        5)  translate these files. These have been composed from the
            the old status bar documentation, so there's little to
            actually translate. You can simply copy your old
            translations to the new files. See the notes in those files
            for details.

        Also, I have integrated the NetscDDE documentation into the
        main INF file. Copy all nsd_* files into /inf.001 and also
        netscape.gif.

    xfldr001.hlp:
        "set_11replicons.html" has been altered to reflect
        the new icon features.

    xfldr001.sgs:
        two more pages were inserted into the SmartGuide script, as
        suggested by Roger Lindmark, Sweden. Look for "V0.84" strings
        again.

    xfcls001.txt:
        changed a few more class descriptions. See the
        notes at the bottom of that file.


    /MAIN
    -----

    Oh, just lots of stuff. Separated more files into more files
    again, and lots of little changes. I was too lazy to document
    all this any more.


Changes for V0.83
=================

    National Language Support
    -------------------------

    xfldr001.inf:
        I have rearranged the panels in the table
        of contents to make the documentation a
        bit clearer, because it was getting difficult
        to overlook what was where. You will need to
        change the following:

        1) use the updated root file (xfldr001.html)
           because the level-1 entries have changed;
        2) put "/tools/strrpl.exe" on your PATH;
        3) execute "/inf.001/ren083.cmd" on your
           existing translation to have all your files
           renamed and links updated automatically.
           I have written this to aid you in the
           process of rearranging the documentation;
           this should also help for future updates,
           because every time I change something, it
           makes me feel bad since this is additional
           work for you. ;-)

        Then do a global search in the new INF.001
        directory for "V0.83" strings, which should
        lead you to the separate paragraphs which
        might have changed. As always, I have marked
        the changed items with HTML comments. You can
        then update your translation.

    /HELPERS
    --------

    -- new stringh.* files which contain all the
       string helper functions previously located
       in dosh.*, which didn't make much sense.
       These funcs have the "strh*" prefix.

    /MAIN
    -----

    Reworked xfldr.mak so that the /HELPERS .OBJ
    files are created in /MAIN too. That's because
    my other software uses the helper functions too,
    and might need different compiler options for
    them, so we need different .OBJ files. Also, this
    makes the makefiles a bit clearer.

    Also, there were a few false shaky compiler
    options in the makefiles for V0.82, which made
    XFolder refuse to work sometimes. That was just
    if you tried to compile it for yourself.


Changes for V0.82
=================

    National Language Support
    -------------------------

    Just a few corrections and additions. Note that
    XFolder V0.82 will work with V0.81 NLS support,
    so changing the following stuff is not required
    to make V0.82 work.

    xfcls001.txt:
    --  added a few more class descriptions.

    xfldr001.hlp:
    --  I've updated a few help panels because they
        contained outdated information. To update
        your translations, see the notes for
        xfldr001.hlp for V0.81 below.

    xfldr001.inf:
    --  Updated a panels here also.
    --  Split up the "FAQ" section across several
        pages and added more questions.

    xfldr001.dlg:
    --  first "Context menu" page had "Widerrufen"
        and "Hilfe" buttons. That's German for "Undo"
        and "Help", in case you didn't find out. ;-)
        Changed this to the English counterparts.
        (That's the ID_XSD_SET25ADDMENUS template
        again.) This is just a bug in the English
        support, so don't worry.
    --  There was a slight bug in ID_XSD_SETTINGS_DTP1.
        The "1.1" entry should have had an ID of
        "ID_XSDI_SD_APMVERSION"; replace the "-1" with
        that string.

    /HELPERS
    --------

    -- procstat.*: changed all the function
       prefixes to "prc".

    -- eas.*: dramatic speed increase (up to
       300%) for querying size of EAs for a file.

    -- winh.*: new function winhAssertWarp4Notebook
       to make buttons Warp-4-notebook compatible.

    /MAIN
    -----

    Major changes to many files.
    See the XFolder Revision history in the INF files.


    Miscellaneae
    ------------

    repclass.c: made the text output a bit more lucid.

    treesize.*: now using faster /helpers/eas.* code,
        more options, etc. See "Revision history" in
        the INF file.


Changes for V0.81
=================

    National Language Support
    -------------------------

    Sorry, I promised not to change anything, but the
    problems which have arised with V0.80 forced me
    to redesign a number of things. Also, a few users
    complained about outdated or incomplete help panels,
    so I changed a number of those also.

    If you are currently working on the translation
    of XFolder to your language, don't worry. You won't
    have to re-translate everything. See the notes
    below.

    HOWEVER, please mind the following notes, especially
    because "main/dlgids.h" has changed.

    *.ipf: I have removed these files from the source
        package, because you can easily create them
        yourself and I'm running out of web space.
        Run "make.cmd" to have them created, if you
        need them.

    html2ipf.cmd: I have made more changes to that
        excellent utility to make it more
        HTML-compliant. I suggest using the newer
        version. Put it on your PATH somewhere
        See NLS.TXT for details.

    xfldr001.hlp:
        - reworked various menu-item help panels to
          display additional information where this
          menu item can be configured.
        - changed help panels for "Context menu"
          page, because that page has also changed.

        To keep your existing translation efforts
        intact, do the following:

        1) open the _new_ HELP.001 directory (I
           recommend using small icons)
        2) sort everything by "last write date"
        3) delete all the files that are older
           than the release date of the old
           XFolder source package, i.e. Oct. 1,
           1998.
        4) Copy all the files from the _old_ HELP.001
           directory into the _new_ directory. When
           the WPS asks you whether to replace a
           file, always select "Cancel" for that
           file so that it's not replaced.

        As a result, you should now have an updated
        HELP.001 directory. For the remaining files,
        i.e. those which I have changed, look into
        the .HTML files where I have inserted comments
        about what has changed. Most of the time,
        it's only one paragraph, so you can use your
        translation and update it.

        Sorry for the hassle.

    xfldr001.inf:
        - updated "Comments" page.
        - combined "Known limitations" and "Tips&Tricks"
          into a new and updated "FAQ" section. That is,
          "vers_3limit.html" and "070tips.html" have
          been removed. Instead, there's now "070faq.html".
        - updated outdated link descriptions which
          now refer to the "Workplace Shell" object.

        Apply the same procedure as with the .HLP files
        described above.

    xfldr001.rc:
        - one listbox item was still called "Insert",
          but it should have been "Paste".

    xfldr001.dlg:
        - the "Add context menu items" page was
          redesigned. It is at the very bottom of
          the .DLG text file (ID_XSD_SET25ADDMENUS)

        NOTE: If you have already translated parts of
        the dialog resources, do not simply copy stuff
        around and then open the .RES file with the
        dialog editor, because the dlgids.h file has
        changed. This will blow up all the dialog ID's,
        rendering your NLS DLL unusable.

        Instead, do the following:

        1) delete the ID_XSD_SET25ADDMENUS dialog
           template from your old .DLG file (all the
           stuff between "DLGTEMPLATE ID_XSD_SET25ADDMENUS"
           and the "END" statement on the same level)
        2) copy the same template from the new .DLG file
           to the bottom of your old .DLG file
        3) copy the old .DLG file into the new \001
           directory
        4) re-make the NLS DLL to have the .RES file
           updated.

        You can _then_ open the .RES file with the
        dialog editor.

    dlgid's.h (in the \MAIN directory):
        - changed a number of dialog ID's. This affects
          the dialog templates, as described above.


    Main Module
    -----------

    Looks like we have much more source code, but actually
    we have less. ;-) I have added a lot more files though
    and spread the code across these new files to make it
    easier to find certain functions.

    Check the new section in readme.txt about the new
    function prefixes which will allow you to determine
    the source file from the function name.

    Also removed some dead code from all the files.

    New source files:
        - all the files in the new /HELPERS directory;
          I have extracted the helper functions from the
          various source files which should be possible
          to compile without XFolder and put all these
          in here. Check the header files for a
          description of what these do.
        - /main/menus.* for all the menu functions formerly
          in xfldr.c
        - /main/module.* for DLL initialization/termination
        - /main/statbars.* for status bar mnemonic logic which
          was previously done using SOM multiple inheritance

    Renamed xfsort.* to cnrsort.* so that it does not
    look like SOM code any more.

    Renamed objdlgs.* to classlst.* and made it contain
    only the "WPS class list" code.

    all xf*.* files:
        - SOM hierarchy changed
        - multiple inheritance removed
        - removed xfclsQueryModule methods and calls thereto
          and replaced these with calls to the new module.c
          functions

    Replacement class XFldProgram removed.

    common.*:
        - moved animation code to /helpers/animate.*.
        - moved XFldObject::xfCreateFromTemplate to
          cmnCreateFromTemplate into this file; added
          more error checking

    classlst.h:
        - changed all function prefixes to cls*.
        - moved "Object Internals" to xfobj.c,
          where it makes more sense

    dlgids.h:
        see NLS section below.

    xfldr.c:
        - removed several SOM methods.
        - moved all the menu functions into the new
          menus.c file.

    xfdesk.c:
        - changed all the animations to use the new
          improved animation code in /helpers/animate.c.

    xfdisk.c:
        - changed those xfQuery* funcs to work on non-
          removeable drives only.

    xffsys.c:
        - removed several SOM methods.
        - moved all the "settings" menu functions into
          the new menus.c file.

    xfobj.c:
        - removed several SOM methods.
        - moved all the "settings" menu functions into
          the new menus.c file.

    xfsys.c:
        - fixed a few bugs in CONFIG.SYS handling
        - changed dlg* functions to stg*
        - changed replaced WPSystem methods so that
          XFldWPS now inherits WPSystem pages, while
          XFldSystem ("OS/2 Kernel") does not.

    xfldr.mak:
        - inference rules updated (incomplete in V0.80).
        - new dependencies on /helpers/helpers.mak.
        - made icc produce separate precompiled header
          files for each .C file.

    xfldr.rc:
        - removed that dull menu template which kept
          XFolder from building properly.

    install.cmd:
        - deregistering old / registering new classes

    inst*.msg:
        - install *.msg files updated for this

    crobj*.cmd:
        - moved code for non-config-folder objects into
          new scripts "instl*.cmd" which are only
          executed after installation.
