#   make\comp_classcode.in:
#
#       include file for nmake that defines the inference
#       rule for compiling class object code from C files.
#       This has been put into this include file because
#       I finally got tired of changing this rule in a
#       dozen makefiles all the time.
#
#       !include this file only for code that goes into
#       XFLDR.DLL. This uses the $(CC_DLL_MT) compiler
#       setup.
#

# Define inference rules for what to do with certain file
# types, based on their file extension.
# The syntax we need here is ".fromext.toext".
# So whenever NMAKE encounters a .toext file, it
# executes what we specify here.
# The ugly {} brackets are some awkward syntax for specifying
# files in other directories.

# Special macros used here: $(@B) is the current target w/out ext.

# -- compile C files to .OBJ files, using the $(CC_DLL_MT) macro
#    defined in setup.in.
#    The output will be placed in the directory specified by
#    the OUTPUTDIR variable (set above).
