
This file lists bugs known to the current XWorkplace release.
I keep adding bugs which are reported through xworkplace-user@egroups.com
to this file and remove them when they are fixed.

Please don't report bugs which are already mentioned in this file. Thanks.

Even though this file might look dangerously large, this doesn't mean that
XWorkplace is dangerously unstable. Many of the bugs below are only minor
quirks or funny misbehaviors which will not cause your system to hang or
crash. And even if some behavior is not acceptable, you can always disable
XWorkplace features in the "XWorkplace Setup" object.

CURRENT PROBLEMS
----------------

BTW, Check Desktop Integrity in XWP Setup is missing its descriptive
entry in the .TMF file.


--  override all wpQuery/SetIconData too

--  align icon page 2 for folders

--  program objects:

    --  changes in the properties of a program object is not reflected
        1) change path in properties
        2) wps doesn't pick up change on double-click
        3) path is still correct in properties

--  replacement icons:

    --  VIO executable icons keep disappearing when templates folder
        was opened

    --  pronews.exe not handled correctly in program object

    --  lost icons for FTP-PM

    --  Icon loading code - I've had to hit Default/Undo on about a half dozen program
        objects to restore the proper icon. I have discovered that this doesn't work
        properly for any *.cmd or *.exe files that don't have custom icons - the icon is
        always changing back to the open font folder icon (???). It also seems that the
        icons for attachments in PMMail have been adversely affected, as many are now
        showing as blank. I see in the BUGS file that you noticed the problem with
        ProNews - but the problem is much more widespread.

--  when you open the object properties of an application from the File
    Types tab of the Workplace Shell object, the icon disappears. Selecting
    something else and coming back, the icon will show up again.

--  errors when deinstalling fonts from the font folder say that there was
    an error when installing fonts.

--  Extended Shutdown: Adding a partition to the menu, initially has
    the wrong partition name shown if the name is longer than 8
    characters. On LVM volumes they can be much longer. Manualy typing
    the correct name (in quotes if it contains spaces) solves this
    problem.

--  Kernel object: Errors page, Drive for POPUPLOG.OS2 shows
    incorrect drive (always the first HD on your system)

--  XCenter: Double clicking clock object doesn't bring-up the clock
    properties in eCS.


OLDER, MINOR PROBLEMS
---------------------

--  XCenter:
    --  double-click on tray empty space produces click on icon too
    --  spacing lines are missing on trays
    --  if tray is on top, icons are moved down (xwpbug.jpg)
    --  dragging XCenter widget text files can hang WPS (check file types?)

    --  "show frame" setting on a per-widget basis

    --  winlist widget behavior: make buttons wider (configurable)

    --  add "rightmost" setting

    --  allow icon resize

    --  3D border size not respected with "resize desktop"
    --  exclude frame border from desktop workarea too

    --  rework stay on top

    --  template object buttons...

    --  add option for tooltip shadows.

    --  winlist: truncate titles with "..."

    --  XCenter xbutton: suspend doesn't always work

    --  restoring VIO sessions:
        check in the window words for this.
        For minimized and for maximized there are window
        words for the x and y position.
        If a window has not been minimized/maximized, those
        values will be -1.
        If it was minimized/maximized at least once, those
        values will be <> -1.
        So you might want to check the x and y values for
        the "maximize" window words (while the window is
        not destroyed yet, of course).
        If they are <> -1 then this window was maximized
        and x and y was the maximized position (whatever
        that would be for a maximized window, should be 0
        and 0 ?)

--  TMF file ends with strange char

--  install: subdir plugins\drvdlgs not created?!

--  startup:
    --  boot logo remains on screen forever (check startup sequence for whether
        this might be lost somwhere)

--  drive not ready:
    reports garbage with TVFS drives

--  setup strings for WPShadow: SHADOWID (?) not reported

--  ext assocs:
    >Finally, I use a REXX script to unzip *.ZIP files; it is linked to a program object
    associated with ZIP files, that has this string as parameter:
    "O:\TMP %*"
    to specify where to unpack and Zip file name. Using extended file type association,
    the script fails to open Zip files stored in folders containing spaces in their
    name. Maybe this problem is common to all objects that use "%*" as parameter...

sort:
    --  sort by type doesn't sort files with same (or no) type

install:
    --  if lockup on start is enabled, first xwp msg box hangs the system
        after install.

trash can:
    --  When deleting a folder wich has an other folder inside wich has the
        attribut "read only", destroying of this folder in trashcan will fail,
        some beeps are played and a message appears
        "object xxx cant be deleted - either it is use or write protected"

documentation:
    -- some subsections in the TOC of the user guide are currently
       sorted wrong. This will be fixed in a future release, didn't
       have time now.

trash can:
    -- When I activate "Replace true delete" (I don't use the TrashCan), I get the
       new XWP dialog when I delete objects via popup menus, but the regular OS/2
       one if I just press the "del" key. Of course I get it all the time if
       "replace true delete" is not active <g>.

    -- When you delete an object, it probably retains its object ID, because
       if a program tries to UPDATE the object that has been deleted, it
       effectively updates the object in the TrashCan, while it should
       create a new one.

       --> not easy to fix at this point, but will be fixed once the file
           handles engine has been reworked.

prog start:
    --  cmd files not started minimized?

--  In the "keyboard" object, looking at the "hotkeys" page I see an object
    associated with "LeftWin" key. This is one of 3 key mappings I defined
    to use the new "Windows" keys on my keyboard. The (little) problem is
    that it shows only "LeftWin", while the exact hotkey should be
    CTRL+ALT+LeftWin. BTW, it works as expected. Did this even with 0.9.8.

tooltips:
    -- rewrite auto-pop

XWPSetup:
    -- "Undo" and "Default" don't affect newer settings (trashcan);
       PageMage isn't affected

folders:
    --  sorting: sorts wrong after renaming file (intercept cnr msg)

    --  dragging stuff to folders crashes WPS if folder is being populated
            (probably a WPS bug)

NetscDDE:
    -- With the Netscape DDE feature Netscape does not get the right location of
       what to display - the '„' (german Umlaut) gets lost.

OS/2 Kernel:
    -- Set Path -> Browse will not work (Standard file dialog doesn't react when
       OK is pressed -> nothing happens.

    -- Select invalid on classpath selects all zip files.

hotkeys:
       if batchfiles should start in minimized state, from time to time
       they appear on desktop.
        --> check VIO hacks?

PageMage:
    --  bring window to current screen before making it sticky
    --  causes PM lockups at times (Ctrl+Esc unlocks)
    --  make window larger than desktop, set pagemage 1x4 and move big window
        so it will be in 1 and 2 desktop - switching desktops and moving this
        window causes PM lockup.

hook:
    --  screen borders page:
        object setting won't stick sometimes.

    --  there is a little bug with the settings notebook of the mouse - movement 2.
        I can drag and drop objects to the open object, but it doesn't work with
        the pickup and drop feature of Warp. Than there is no object given.

    --  When Sliding focus is On, in seamless WinOS2 programs like MS Excel
        when you right-click and then move your mouse over the context menu
        it immediately disappears, so you actually cannot use it.

    -- sliding focus:
       -- topmost window doesn't become active after previous wnd destroy

    -- MB3 scroll:
       -- VIEW.EXE TOC not fully shown

    -- VIO copy conflicts with WM_CHORD; check window class. Doesn't work on
       Win-OS/2 either?
