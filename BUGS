
This file lists bugs known to the current XWorkplace release.
I keep adding bugs which are reported through xworkplace-user@egroups.com
to this file and remove them when they are fixed.

Please don't report bugs which are already mentioned in this file. Thanks.

Even though this file might look dangerously large, this doesn't mean that
XWorkplace is dangerously unstable. Many of the bugs below are only minor
quirks or funny misbehaviors which will not cause your system to hang or
crash. And even if some behavior is not acceptable, you can always disable
XWorkplace features in the "XWorkplace Setup" object.

NOT-SO-SERIOUS PROBLEMS
-----------------------

--  fix xfix

--  xcenter:
    stays visible with lockup screen and stay-on-top.

--  winlist: left to right.

--  when I shut down (extended
    shutdown) while a print job is in the queue (forgotten, printer turned
    off), then XWP asks if the print job shall be killed. If I click "yes",
    it will hang on shutdown for quite some time. Then, when turning the
    machine on, it will not start properly but hang at the first or second
    object in the startup-folder. Acitivity is still possible, but at some
    later point, the machine hangs completely. The print job is still found
    in the queue! Once the print job is killed manually, everything works
    fine.

tooltips:
    -- rewrite auto-pop

XCenter:
    -- put menus on object buttons on top of the bar, not on top of the button.

    -- add option for tooltip shadows.

    -- winlist: truncate titles with "..."

    -- winlist: maximized VIO windows/FS sessions

    -- make object buttons droppable

XWPSetup:
    -- "Undo" and "Default" don't affect newer settings (trashcan);
       PageMage isn't affected

sounds:
    -- "Enable system sounds" on "Sound" page has no immediate effect;
       however, this didn't work for old WPS page either

folders:
    -- dragging stuff to folders crashes WPS if folder is being populated
            (probably a WPS bug)

    -- shadows missing if "always sort" and "folders first" are enabled (?!?)

file exists dlg:
    --  Right click on a file object (program object does not cause this bug)
        select copy.
        >-enter new name(different one), leave it to default folder which should be
        >the one where the file was selected
        >and voila pop-up appears telling user that there is a name conflict, but the
        >new name is not in that folder!

trash can:
    -- sorting doesn't work right... i need to rewrite sorting anyway.

    -- When you delete an object, it probably retains its object ID, because
       if a program tries to UPDATE the object that has been deleted, it
       effectively updates the object in the TrashCan, while it should
       create a new one.

NetscDDE:
    -- With the Netscape DDE feature Netscape does not get the right location of
       what to display - the '„' (german Umlaut) gets lost.

OS/2 Kernel:
    -- Set Path -> Browse will not work (Standard file dialog doesn't react when
       OK is pressed -> nothing happens.

hotkeys:
    > > >There's one more problem - my batchfiles should start in
    > > minimized state,
    > > >but from time to time they appear on desktop. Can you check this?
    > > Not XWP's fault. XWP opens the object in its default view,
    > > which, for batch files, is handled by the internal WPS
    > > code.
    --> check VIO hacks?

hook:
    --  sliding menus:
            -- no submenu delays for menu bars (immediate open)

    --  there is a little bug with the settings notebook of the mouse - movement 2.
        I can drag and drop objects to the open object, but it doesn't work with
        the pickup and drop feature of Warp. Than there is no object given.

    --  When Sliding focus is On, in seamless WinOS2 programs like MS Excel
        when you right-click and then move your mouse over the context menu
        it immediately disappears, so you actually cannot use it.

    -- sliding focus:
       -- topmost window doesn't become active after previous wnd destroy

    -- MB3 scroll:
       -- VIEW.EXE TOC not fully shown

    -- VIO copy conflicts with WM_CHORD; check window class. Doesn't work on
       Win-OS/2 either?
