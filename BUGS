
This file lists bugs known to the current XWorkplace release.
I keep adding bugs which are reported through xworkplace-user@yahoogroups.com
to this file and remove them when they are fixed.

Please don't report bugs which are already mentioned in this file. Thanks.

Even though this file might look dangerously large, this doesn't mean that
XWorkplace is dangerously unstable. Many of the bugs below are only minor
quirks or funny misbehaviors which will not cause your system to hang or
crash. And even if some behavior is not acceptable, you can always disable
XWorkplace features in the "XWorkplace Setup" object.

CURRENT PROBLEMS
----------------

--  when hook is disabled, window list widget doesn't work; restart of
    XCenter required for getting it to work

--  xcenter: doesn't remember tray from last startup

--  Batch rename window opens twice when selected from folder context
    menu

--  File type exports:
    Although the header is
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
    I can see the extended accented characters in E when my system is using
    CP 850.

--  If speech is installed, notebook pages lack the "Speech" tab.

--  There's already a hotkey option for 'Pickup' and 'Cancel pickup', so why
    not just add the same option for the drop actions as well. This would
    simplify file managing significantly using keyboard only.

--  Double-clicking on attachments in pmmail opens the wrong assoc.

--  Command line windows lose frame icons all the time.

--  rework trash can mappings to reuse directories after empty

--  b5) Starting Programs: Since upgrading to 0.9.19, the RCJ CD Writer
    Error Log dosn't start-up minimised anymore. I've seen this behaviour
    with 0.9.14, but with that it happened only once every 20 boots or so.
    Now however this behaviour turns-up 100% of the time.

--  Regular Expressions
    At least in the select by name dialog the expression "5[67]."
    matches the files 567, 576, but also 562blabla, which it should not
    ("Regular expressions" is  switched on). The same happens with
    "5[67]", while "5[68]" only selects 567 and 562blabla.

--  New file dialog
    +   When called from the XButton settings Browse button, the dialog is
        always starting at F:\ -- the programs disk with XWP on it, so that
        could be logical. But it always starts there no matter what
        directory I was in before and what is written in the entry field for
        the bitmap.
    +   I would expect to be able to change directories with a double click
        on the folder symbol in the right hand part, but this does not work.
    +   It should remember the position of the slider separating the left
        from the right part.

--  >I have a program object defined for ZIP-files with
    >   Program: unzip.exe
    > Parameters: "%*" -d "g:\Work\%**n"
    >
    >It works fine with the normal WPS associations. But with XWP's
    >extended associations I get this error:
    >  checkdir: cannot create extraction directory: g:/Work"

    OK, the problem remains with XWP-0.9.19, although the error message is now
       checkdir: cannot create extraction directory: g:/Work/%**n

    And it does not matter, if I have "Change parameter list" switched on or off.

--  WarpCenter doesn't disappear from window list

--  vertical resizing of pager doesn't work, even though mouse
    pointer is changed to size on frame

--  sticky windows: adding a sticky window that is currently on
    a non-active desktop will always keep it off the current
    desktop --> bring it to current before making it sticky

--  SHADOWS: with turbofolders/ext assocs, apparently when
    WPShadow makes objects awake, it bypasses my initialization
    code, which at least does NOT work in the case that a
    file-system object contains several dots in the filename
    (because our list isn't checked) --> wrong datafile class
    (possibly broken icons too).

--  XFldProgramFile: Parameter and Working dir settings
    specified in a settings notebook are presently ignored.

--  WPProgramFile objects normally have a menu item called "Create
    Program Object". This disappears in XWPProgramFile and is
    replaced with "Create Another".

--  Selecting "Original" -> "Delete" from a shadow context menu
    sometimes deletes the wrong object if replacement delete
    is enabled.

--  shutdown: waits forever on exceptions to finish

--  Sound: Change of volume is not always reflected. It seems to be
    reflected after a schema change and a reboot only.

--  programs: NLS settings are not respected

--  file(2) page: allow delete of EAs, edit EAT_ASCII

--  pagemage: vx-rexx patch breaks several apps, such as
    visual slick edit and mr2ice status window

--  enabling hook won't stick on some systems

--  replacement icons:

    --  xshutdown in xwp folder has default vio icon

    --  pronews.exe shows default icon in program object

    --  association icons disappear if source object goes dormant

--  when you open the object properties of an application from the File
    Types tab of the Workplace Shell object, the icon disappears. Selecting
    something else and coming back, the icon will show up again.

--  errors when deinstalling fonts from the font folder say that there was
    an error when installing fonts.

--  Kernel object: Errors page, Drive for POPUPLOG.OS2 shows
    incorrect drive (always the first HD on your system)


OLDER, MINOR PROBLEMS
---------------------

--  XCenter:
    --  spacing lines are missing on trays
    --  if tray is on top, icons are moved down (xwpbug.jpg)

    --  "show frame" setting on a per-widget basis

    --  winlist widget behavior: make buttons wider (configurable)

    --  add "rightmost" setting

    --  allow icon resize

    --  3D border size not respected with "resize desktop"
    --  exclude frame border from desktop workarea too

    --  rework stay on top

    --  template object buttons...

    --  add option for tooltip shadows.

    --  winlist: truncate titles with "..."

    --  XCenter xbutton: suspend doesn't always work

    --  restoring VIO sessions:
        check in the window words for this.
        For minimized and for maximized there are window
        words for the x and y position.
        If a window has not been minimized/maximized, those
        values will be -1.
        If it was minimized/maximized at least once, those
        values will be <> -1.
        So you might want to check the x and y values for
        the "maximize" window words (while the window is
        not destroyed yet, of course).
        If they are <> -1 then this window was maximized
        and x and y was the maximized position (whatever
        that would be for a maximized window, should be 0
        and 0 ?)

--  TMF file ends with strange char

--  install: subdir plugins\drvdlgs not created?!

--  startup:
    --  boot logo remains on screen forever (check startup sequence for whether
        this might be lost somwhere)

--  drive not ready:
    reports garbage with TVFS drives

--  setup strings for WPShadow: SHADOWID (?) not reported

install:
    --  if lockup on start is enabled, first xwp msg box hangs the system
        after install.

trash can:
    --  When deleting a folder wich has an other folder inside wich has the
        attribut "read only", destroying of this folder in trashcan will fail,
        some beeps are played and a message appears
        "object xxx cant be deleted - either it is use or write protected"

documentation:
    -- some subsections in the TOC of the user guide are currently
       sorted wrong. This will be fixed in a future release, didn't
       have time now.

trash can:
    -- When you delete an object, it probably retains its object ID, because
       if a program tries to UPDATE the object that has been deleted, it
       effectively updates the object in the TrashCan, while it should
       create a new one.

       --> not easy to fix at this point, but will be fixed once the file
           handles engine has been reworked.

prog start:
    --  cmd files not started minimized?

--  In the "keyboard" object, looking at the "hotkeys" page I see an object
    associated with "LeftWin" key. This is one of 3 key mappings I defined
    to use the new "Windows" keys on my keyboard. The (little) problem is
    that it shows only "LeftWin", while the exact hotkey should be
    CTRL+ALT+LeftWin. BTW, it works as expected. Did this even with 0.9.8.

XWPSetup:
    -- "Undo" and "Default" don't affect newer settings (trashcan);
       PageMage isn't affected

    --  3.- This is purely cosmetic, I think: if you go to XWP settings, "Features"
        page, and expand the "file operations" tree USING THE MOUSE, and then
        collapse it using the mouse again, the focus will be passed to the
        "startup/shutdown features" entry, instead to the "file operations". All the
        other entries behave OK, and all respond ok to keyboard expand/collapse.

folders:
    --  sorting: sorts wrong after renaming file (intercept cnr msg)

    --  dragging stuff to folders crashes WPS if folder is being populated
            (probably a WPS bug)

NetscDDE:
    -- With the Netscape DDE feature Netscape does not get the right location of
       what to display - the '„' (german Umlaut) gets lost.

OS/2 Kernel:
    -- Set Path -> Browse will not work (Standard file dialog doesn't react when
       OK is pressed -> nothing happens.

    -- "Select invalid" on CLASSPATH selects all zip files.

hotkeys:
       if batchfiles should start in minimized state, from time to time
       they appear on desktop.
        --> check VIO hacks?

PageMage:
    --  bring window to current screen before making it sticky

hook:
    --  screen borders page:
        object setting won't stick sometimes.

    --  there is a little bug with the settings notebook of the mouse - movement 2.
        I can drag and drop objects to the open object, but it doesn't work with
        the pickup and drop feature of Warp. Than there is no object given.

    --  When Sliding focus is On, in seamless WinOS2 programs like MS Excel
        when you right-click and then move your mouse over the context menu
        it immediately disappears, so you actually cannot use it.

    -- sliding focus:
       -- topmost window doesn't become active after previous wnd destroy

    -- MB3 scroll:
       -- VIEW.EXE TOC not fully shown

    -- VIO copy conflicts with WM_CHORD; check window class. Doesn't work on
       Win-OS/2 either?
