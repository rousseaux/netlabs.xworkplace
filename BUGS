
This file lists bugs known to the current XWorkplace release.
I keep adding bugs which are reported through xworkplace-user@egroups.com
to this file and remove them when they are fixed.

Please don't report bugs which are already mentioned in this file. Thanks.

Even though this file might look dangerously large, this doesn't mean that
XWorkplace is dangerously unstable. Many of the bugs below are only minor
quirks or funny misbehaviors which will not cause your system to hang or
crash. And even if some behavior is not acceptable, you can always disable
XWorkplace features in the "XWorkplace Setup" object.

SERIOUS PROBLEMS
----------------

--  "create another" for folders can lead to black-screen trap (see readme)

-- Clicking "Refresh" in the "object" strap of an object causes a WPS-Hangup.

file page:
    -- Opening the context menu of swapper.dat and selecting the "file" strap(?)
       causes a WPS-hangup.
    -- Same with chkdsk.log. Apparently EA handling is buggy somewhere.

--  XShutdown creates 0-byte OS2.INI.

NOT-SO-SERIOUS PROBLEMS
-----------------------

misc:
    -- install: XWPScreen no work; probably the old DLL is still in use
       when replaced (DosReplaceModule)
    -- XWPSETUP: check objects at startup; disable menu items if creation was successful

folders:
    -- using WarpCenter moves icons upwards at each WPS startup
    -- dragging stuff to folders crashes WPS if folder is being populated
    -- On some objects the delete menu item appears to try to delete the
       parent folder of the item rather than the item itself.  This appears
       to be a consistent error ie. the problem always appears for a given
       object but other objects are OK.  Using the delete key seems to work
       fine.
       Using the delete key works OK.
       Disabling the true delete has no affect - error still present.
       Disabling trashcan restores the default WPS behaviour (obviously)
       which does not display the error.

status bars:
    -- hidden records are counted in total objects count (Templates folder)

trash can:
    -- open subfolders are not closed when deleting parent folder
    -- sorting doesn't work right
    -- Drives page: multiple selections are not all moved

archiving:
    -- after restoring a backup, archiving is enabled because of the
       date. We should disable archiving when an archive was just
       restored.

startup folder:
    -- The range check at "XFolder Startup"'s settings book ("Setup"?) (why not
       "XWorkplace Startup"?) with "Xworkplace Startup folder" is wrong while getting
       down from 500 to 10000, but from 10000 up to 750. Why no option for 250ms?

other settings pages:
    -- XWPSetup: "Undo" and "Default" don't affect newer settings (trashcan);
       PageMage isn't affected
    -- System paths:
       -- scroll listbox to first visible

NetscDDE:
    -- With the Netscape DDE feature Netscape does not get the right location of
       what to display - the '„' (german Umlaut) gets lost.

icons:
    -- trash can icons...
    -- program file icons changing when settings notebook is opened

create objects:
    -- check "Shift" with creating objects
    -- select editable title

hook:
    -- hotkeys:
       -- don't work on fresh install

    -- auto-hide pointer:
       -- no work when typing in PM window
       -- disappears while MB3-scrolling or Mb1-menus
       -- above WarpCenter menus, the mouse disappears and never comes back. ?!?!?

    -- MB3 scroll:
       -- VIEW.EXE TOC not fully shown

    -- VIO copy conflicts with WM_CHORD; check window class

PageMage:
    -- maximized windows show border on adjacent screen; hide them when switching...
    -- PageMage client fails to repaint on reshow
    -- PageMage doesn't show up sometimes
    -- Desktop not recognized sometimes
