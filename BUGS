
This file lists bugs known to the current XWorkplace release.
I keep adding bugs which are reported through xworkplace-user@egroups.com
to this file and remove them when they are fixed. Please don't report
bugs which are already mentioned in this file. Thanks.

folders:
    -- WarpCenter moves icons upwards
    -- noticed a problem with the replacement 'File exists' dialogue. If you
       open a folder that contains objects, then rmb on an object and select
       'Create another' from the popup menu, the 'create another' dialogue
       opens with 'the object type (eg 'Folder' or 'Data file') as the 'New
       name'. Change it to something else, for example 'anyfing', click
       'Create', and the 'File conflict' dialogue pops up identifying the
       object on which you used the rmb. I'm using WSeB, no fixpacks.

trash can:
    -- close subfolders too
    -- check if delete works if not yet populated...
    -- sorting doesn't work

startup folder:
    -- 1) After pressing Shift during WPS-Startup and skipping the startup folder, a
       RMB and "Start folder content" in the startup folder does not work.
    -- The range check at "XFolder Startup"'s settings book ("Setup"?) (why not
       "XWorkplace Startup"?) with "Xworkplace Startup folder" is wrong while getting
       down from 500 to 10000, but from 10000 up to 750. Why no option for 250ms?
    -- startup folder hangs when white hard error box pops up while processing objects

file page:
    -- 2) Opening the context menu of swapper.dat and selecting the "file" strap(?)
       causes a WPS-hangup.
    -- Same with chkdsk.log. Apparently EA handling is buggy somewhere.

other settings pages:
    -- 8) by chosing "undo" or "default" new entries are created in
       the list "Global XWP features"
    -- 14) Clicking "Refresh" in the "object" strap of an object causes a WPS-Hangup -
       I did not try it much, but it was reproducable with the "UnterstÅtzung"
       object (in german Warp4).

NetscDDE:
    -- 12) With the Netscape DDE feature Netscape does not get the right location of
       what to display - the 'Ñ' (german Umlaut) gets lost.

icons:
    -- trash can icons...
    -- program file icons changing when settings notebook is opened

drive objects: network drives don't work

create objects:
    -- check "Shift" with creating objects
    -- select editable title

hook:
    -- VIO copy conflicts with WM_CHORD; check window class
    -- WM_CHORD over Netscape/PMMail no work
    -- sliding focus over MDI frames no work
    -- sliding focus windows appear/disappear
    -- 7) Mouse object / Movement: "windows to top" and "Ignore WinOS/2" does not
       ignore WinOS/2 windows.
    -- 13) The displaying window in keyboard object / hotkeys should be a bit wider,
       so you would not have to horizontally scroll all the time.
    -- 10) I had problem with my second installation of XWp. I installed, but
       afterwards it was not possible to check "Enable global object hotkeys"
       unless (afaik) I temporarily turned sliding focus on. (the Hook etc was - of
       course - installed).
       But I reinstalled XWorkplace on a new partition (with a new Warp4, FP12, DDFix,
       ..) and the same happened. I was not able to enable the global hotkeys - unless
       I temporarily turned the sliding focus on. So it is definetely reproducable.
