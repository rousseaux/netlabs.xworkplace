
This file lists bugs known to the current XWorkplace release.
I keep adding bugs which are reported through xworkplace-user@egroups.com
to this file and remove them when they are fixed.

Please don't report bugs which are already mentioned in this file. Thanks.

Even though this file might look dangerously large, this doesn't mean that
XWorkplace is dangerously unstable. Many of the bugs below are only minor
quirks or funny misbehaviors which will not cause your system to hang or
crash. And even if some behavior is not acceptable, you can always disable
XWorkplace features in the "XWorkplace Setup" object. This applies to
PageMage especially.

SERIOUS PROBLEMS
----------------

--  "create another" for folders can lead to black-screen trap (see readme)


FIXPAK 13/14
------------

This is my private bug list for FP13/14:

-- Sometimes after a WPS restart, the WPS doesn't populate
   the Desktop, and the system hangs. I'm not sure what this
   is about. This doesn't happen with FP11, and it happens
   with my Desktop even if I disable XWP.

-- IBM has ruined the DosQProcStat and DosQuerySysState APIs.
   These still return garbage with FP14 sometimes.

-- Apparently, DosPerfSysCall doesn't work any more either.

-- Please don't complain about misaligned text in Details
   views, which is no longer vertically centered. It's not
   XWorkplace's fault, but another bug introduced with FP13
   or 14, I don't know. I only noticed it now after installing
   FP14.


NOT-SO-SERIOUS PROBLEMS
-----------------------

>I thought we discussed some time ago removing the "standard shutdown"
>option from the shutdown submenu. If I enable XWP's shutdown but not
>the submenu the 'standard shutdown' is removed from my popup. Why
>can't I get rid of it on the submenu too?

>Finally, on the "File" notebook page (with WarpSans font, resolution
>800x600, 4-digit year YYYY-MM-DD), there is some text clipping evident.

>-Right click on a file object (program object does not cause this bug)
>select copy.
>-enter new name(different one), leave it to default folder which should be
>the one where the file was selected
>and voila pop-up appears telling user that there is a name conflict, but the
>new name is not in that folder!

INF:
    -- add "Sliding menus"
    -- make stable things

XWPString:
    -- d'n'd no work!
    -- confirm no work!

XWPSetup:
    -- "Undo" and "Default" don't affect newer settings (trashcan);
       PageMage isn't affected

sounds:
    -- "Enable system sounds" on "Sound" page has no immediate effect;
       however, this didn't work for old WPS page either

folders:
    -- dragging stuff to folders crashes WPS if folder is being populated
    -- shadows missing if "always sort" and "folders first" are enabled
    -- status bars: object counts not updated when items inserted/removed

trash can:
    -- sorting doesn't work right
    -- When you delete an object, it probably retains its object ID, because
       if a program tries to UPDATE the object that has been deleted, it
       effectively updates the object in the TrashCan, while it should
       create a new one.

NetscDDE:
    -- With the Netscape DDE feature Netscape does not get the right location of
       what to display - the '„' (german Umlaut) gets lost.

PageMage:
    -- mb2 can move desktop
    -- window creation/destroy/activation not recognized sometimes
    >I'm using xworkplace 0.95 and find that the os/2 enhanced
    >editor, EPM, acts as a sticky app in PageMage, even

hook:
    >there is a little bug with the settings notebook of the mouse - movement 2.
    >I can drag and drop objects to the open object, but it doesn't work with
    >the pickup and drop feature of Warp. Than there is no object given.

    -- Mouse pointer doesn't reappear when clicking buttons if hide mouse
       pointer is enabled.

    -- sliding focus:
       -- topmost window doesn't become active after previous wnd destroy

    -- MB3 scroll:
       -- VIEW.EXE TOC not fully shown

    -- VIO copy conflicts with WM_CHORD; check window class
