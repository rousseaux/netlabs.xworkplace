
This file lists bugs known to the current XWorkplace release.
I keep adding bugs which are reported through xworkplace-user@egroups.com
to this file and remove them when they are fixed.

Please don't report bugs which are already mentioned in this file. Thanks.

Even though this file might look dangerously large, this doesn't mean that
XWorkplace is dangerously unstable. Many of the bugs below are only minor
quirks or funny misbehaviors which will not cause your system to hang or
crash. And even if some behavior is not acceptable, you can always disable
XWorkplace features in the "XWorkplace Setup" object.

--  pronews.exe not handled correctly in program object

--  TMF file ends with strange char

--  install: subdir plugins\drvdlgs not created?!

--  XShutdown:
    --  reboot hangs on "releasing filesystems" on some systems

--  XCenter:
    --  double-click on tray empty space produces click on icon too
    --  spacing lines are missing on trays
    --  if tray is on top, icons are moved down (xwpbug.jpg)
    --  dragging XCenter widget text files can hang WPS (check file types?)

--  rc.exe fails on recreating icons.dll

--  startup:
    --  boot logo remains on screen forever (check startup sequence for whether
        this might be lost somwhere)

--  drive not ready:
    reports garbage with TVFS drives

--  Font folder:
    b8) Fontfolder: Deinstalling OS2\DLL\COURIERI.FON, HELVI.FON,
    TIMESI.FON (file not found errors), fails with error 30024.
    b9) Fontfolder: Tms Rmn (TIMES.FON) doesn't show itself correctly
    (i.e. non-sized)

--  folder content functions ignore INCLUDe settings

--  setup strings for WPShadow: SHADOWID (?) not reported

--  ext assocs:
    >Finally, I use a REXX script to unzip *.ZIP files; it is linked to a program object
    associated with ZIP files, that has this string as parameter:
    "O:\TMP %*"
    to specify where to unpack and Zip file name. Using extended file type association,
    the script fails to open Zip files stored in folders containing spaces in their
    name. Maybe this problem is common to all objects that use "%*" as parameter...


MINOR PROBLEMS
--------------

all windows filters (pagemage etc.):
        -- allow wildcards

sort:
    --  sort by type doesn't sort files with same (or no) type

install:
    --  if lockup on start is enabled, first xwp msg box hangs the system
        after install.

trash can:
    --  When deleting a folder wich has an other folder inside wich has the
        attribut "read only", destroying of this folder in trashcan will fail,
        some beeps are played and a message appears
        "object xxx cant be deleted - either it is use or write protected"

documentation:
    -- some subsections in the TOC of the user guide are currently
       sorted wrong. This will be fixed in a future release, didn't
       have time now.

trash can:
    -- When I activate "Replace true delete" (I don't use the TrashCan), I get the
       new XWP dialog when I delete objects via popup menus, but the regular OS/2
       one if I just press the "del" key. Of course I get it all the time if
       "replace true delete" is not active <g>.

    -- When you delete an object, it probably retains its object ID, because
       if a program tries to UPDATE the object that has been deleted, it
       effectively updates the object in the TrashCan, while it should
       create a new one.

       --> not easy to fix at this point, but will be fixed once the file
           handles engine has been reworked.

prog start:
    --  cmd files not started minimized?

XCenter:
    --  "show frame" setting on a per-widget basis

    --  winlist widget behavior: make buttons wider (configurable)

    --  add "rightmost" setting

    --  allow icon resize

    --  3D border size not respected with "resize desktop"
    --  exclude frame border from desktop workarea too

    --  rework stay on top

    --  template object buttons...

    --  add option for tooltip shadows.

    --  winlist: truncate titles with "..."

    --  XCenter xbutton: suspend doesn't always work

    --  restoring VIO sessions:
        check in the window words for this.
        For minimized and for maximized there are window
        words for the x and y position.
        If a window has not been minimized/maximized, those
        values will be -1.
        If it was minimized/maximized at least once, those
        values will be <> -1.
        So you might want to check the x and y values for
        the "maximize" window words (while the window is
        not destroyed yet, of course).
        If they are <> -1 then this window was maximized
        and x and y was the maximized position (whatever
        that would be for a maximized window, should be 0
        and 0 ?)

--  In the "keyboard" object, looking at the "hotkeys" page I see an object
    associated with "LeftWin" key. This is one of 3 key mappings I defined
    to use the new "Windows" keys on my keyboard. The (little) problem is
    that it shows only "LeftWin", while the exact hotkey should be
    CTRL+ALT+LeftWin. BTW, it works as expected. Did this even with 0.9.8.

tooltips:
    -- rewrite auto-pop

XWPSetup:
    -- "Undo" and "Default" don't affect newer settings (trashcan);
       PageMage isn't affected

folders:
    --  sorting: sorts wrong after renaming file (intercept cnr msg)

    --  dragging stuff to folders crashes WPS if folder is being populated
            (probably a WPS bug)

file exists dlg:
    --  Right click on a file object (program object does not cause this bug)
        select copy.
        >-enter new name(different one), leave it to default folder which should be
        >the one where the file was selected
        >and voila pop-up appears telling user that there is a name conflict, but the
        >new name is not in that folder!
    --  When i try to copy an existing object in an folder e.g. 123.bmp and
        give it a new name e.g. 456.bmp and press the "copy" button next
        then, the file exists dialog appears telling me that file 123.bmp already exists.

NetscDDE:
    -- With the Netscape DDE feature Netscape does not get the right location of
       what to display - the '„' (german Umlaut) gets lost.

OS/2 Kernel:
    -- Set Path -> Browse will not work (Standard file dialog doesn't react when
       OK is pressed -> nothing happens.

    -- Select invalid on classpath selects all zip files.

hotkeys:
       if batchfiles should start in minimized state, from time to time
       they appear on desktop.
        --> check VIO hacks?

PageMage:
    --  bring window to current screen before making it sticky
    --  causes PM lockups at times (Ctrl+Esc unlocks)
    --  make window larger than desktop, set pagemage 1x4 and move big window
        so it will be in 1 and 2 desktop - switching desktops and moving this
        window causes PM lockup.

hook:
    --  screen borders page:
        object setting won't stick sometimes.

    --  there is a little bug with the settings notebook of the mouse - movement 2.
        I can drag and drop objects to the open object, but it doesn't work with
        the pickup and drop feature of Warp. Than there is no object given.

    --  When Sliding focus is On, in seamless WinOS2 programs like MS Excel
        when you right-click and then move your mouse over the context menu
        it immediately disappears, so you actually cannot use it.

    -- sliding focus:
       -- topmost window doesn't become active after previous wnd destroy

    -- MB3 scroll:
       -- VIEW.EXE TOC not fully shown

    -- VIO copy conflicts with WM_CHORD; check window class. Doesn't work on
       Win-OS/2 either?
