
This file lists bugs known to the current XWorkplace release.
I keep adding bugs which are reported through xworkplace-user@egroups.com
to this file and remove them when they are fixed.

Please don't report bugs which are already mentioned in this file. Thanks.

Even though this file might look dangerously large, this doesn't mean that
XWorkplace is dangerously unstable. Many of the bugs below are only minor
quirks or funny misbehaviors which will not cause your system to hang or
crash. And even if some behavior is not acceptable, you can always disable
XWorkplace features in the "XWorkplace Setup" object.

misc:
    -- install: XWPScreen no work; probably the old DLL is still in use
       when replaced (DosReplaceModule)
    -- XShutdown and Launchpad no work: did I change "Shutdown" menu ID?

folders:
    -- using WarpCenter moves icons upwards at each WPS startup
    -- "File exists" always pops up when using "Create another" from
       context menu

status bars:
    -- hidden records are counted in total objects count (Templates folder)

trash can:
    -- close subfolders too when deleting parent folder
    -- sorting doesn't work right
    -- Drives page: multiple selections are not all moved

archiving:
    -- after restoring a backup, archiving is enabled because of the
       date. We should disable archiving when an archive was just
       restored.

startup folder:
    -- 1) After pressing Shift during WPS-Startup and skipping the startup folder, a
       RMB and "Start folder content" in the startup folder does not work.
    -- The range check at "XFolder Startup"'s settings book ("Setup"?) (why not
       "XWorkplace Startup"?) with "Xworkplace Startup folder" is wrong while getting
       down from 500 to 10000, but from 10000 up to 750. Why no option for 250ms?
    -- startup folder hangs when white hard error box pops up while processing objects

file page:
    -- 2) Opening the context menu of swapper.dat and selecting the "file" strap(?)
       causes a WPS-hangup.
    -- Same with chkdsk.log. Apparently EA handling is buggy somewhere.

OS/2 Kernel:
    -- "Help" button does nothing in "Configure" dialogs
    -- "Optimize" does nothing with CDFS.IFS
    -- DRVF_NOPARAMS not recognized

other settings pages:
    -- XWPSetup: "Undo" and "Default" don't affect newer settings (trashcan);
       PageMage isn't affected
    -- Clicking "Refresh" in the "object" strap of an object causes a WPS-Hangup.
    -- System paths:
       -- scroll listbox to first visible
       -- check resize controls; crashes on "Close" button

NetscDDE:
    -- With the Netscape DDE feature Netscape does not get the right location of
       what to display - the '„' (german Umlaut) gets lost.

icons:
    -- trash can icons...
    -- program file icons changing when settings notebook is opened

create objects:
    -- check "Shift" with creating objects
    -- select editable title

hook:
    -- auto-hide pointer:
       -- no work when typing in PM window
       -- disappears while MB3-scrolling or Mb1-menus
       -- above WarpCenter menus, the mouse disappears and never comes back. ?!?!?

    -- MB3 scroll:
       -- Netscape hangs
       -- VIEW.EXE TOC not fully shown

    -- VIO copy conflicts with WM_CHORD; check window class

    -- WM_CHORD over Netscape/PMMail no work

    -- function keys (F-keys, Del, Pos, ...) don't work as hotkeys when VIO has focus

    -- sliding focus over MDI subframes no work (VIEW.EXE)

    -- sliding focus windows appear/disappear

    -- Mouse object / Movement: "windows to top" and "Ignore WinOS/2" does not
       ignore WinOS/2 windows.

    -- The displaying window in keyboard object / hotkeys should be a bit wider,
       so you would not have to horizontally scroll all the time.

    -- I had problem with my second installation of XWp. I installed, but
       afterwards it was not possible to check "Enable global object hotkeys"
       unless (afaik) I temporarily turned sliding focus on. (the Hook etc was - of
       course - installed).
       But I reinstalled XWorkplace on a new partition (with a new Warp4, FP12, DDFix,
       ..) and the same happened. I was not able to enable the global hotkeys - unless
       I temporarily turned the sliding focus on. So it is definetely reproducable.

    -- sliding focus closes drop-down box when mouse is above the box's scroll bar

    -- I was still able to trigger the Window list as mouse cursor bug (not as easily,
       though).  I think I did it from PMMail.


PageMage:
    -- maximized windows show border on adjacent screen; hide them when switching...
    -- PageMage client fails to repaint on reshow
    -- PageMage doesn't show up sometimes
    -- Desktop not recognized sometimes
