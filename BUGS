
This file used to list bugs known to the current XWorkplace release.

At the moment, I am setting up a bug tracker for XWorkplace and WarpIN that
will probably be hosted on Netlabs. So there is no bugs list at the moment,
but this will be available shortly. Please watch the usual OS/2 announcement
places for updates.
