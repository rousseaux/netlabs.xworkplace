
This file lists bugs known to the current XWorkplace release.
I keep adding bugs which are reported through xworkplace-user@egroups.com
to this file and remove them when they are fixed.

Please don't report bugs which are already mentioned in this file. Thanks.

Even though this file might look dangerously large, this doesn't mean that
XWorkplace is dangerously unstable. Many of the bugs below are only minor
quirks or funny misbehaviors which will not cause your system to hang or
crash. And even if some behavior is not acceptable, you can always disable
XWorkplace features in the "XWorkplace Setup" object.

MINOR PROBLEMS
--------------

When i try to copy an existing object in an folder e.g. 123.bmp and
give it a new name e.g. 456.bmp and press the "copy" button next
then, the file exists dialog appears telling me that file 123.bmp already exists.

undo wpDelete into trashcan (breaks shredder)

object hotkeys: assign doesn't work if hotkey is invalid

XCenter:
    -- make object buttons droppable!

sounds:
    --  close sound device again

extended file types:
    --  import/export only works once?

XShutdown:
    --  xshutdown folder progress window misnamed ("startup")
    --  2001-06-06 15:11:50 objForAllDirtyObjects (object.c, line 1388):
           Tree node count mismatch.

prog start:
    --  cmd files not started minimized?

XCenter:
    --  winlist widget behavior: make buttons wider (configurable)

    --  add "rightmost" setting

    --  allow icon resize

    --  3D border size not respected with "resize desktop"

    --  rework stay on top

    --  template object buttons...

    --  add option for tooltip shadows.

    --  winlist: truncate titles with "..."

    --  XCenter "Run": causes black screen with Win-OS/2 execs

    --  XCenter xbutton: suspend doesn't always work

    --  restoring VIO sessions:
        check in the window words for this.
        For minimized and for maximized there are window
        words for the x and y position.
        If a window has not been minimized/maximized, those
        values will be -1.
        If it was minimized/maximized at least once, those
        values will be <> -1.
        So you might want to check the x and y values for
        the "maximize" window words (while the window is
        not destroyed yet, of course).
        If they are <> -1 then this window was maximized
        and x and y was the maximized position (whatever
        that would be for a maximized window, should be 0
        and 0 ?)

--  folder refresh:
    causes all DLL icons to be reset.

    2001-05-10: cannot easily be fixed without rewriting the entire folder
    refresh mechanism.

--  status bars:
    If the folder status bar is enabled for the Drives folder (using the default
    status bar) and the active Object in the folder is the "Drive A" object the
    WPS hangs after inserting a non-DOS formated Disk.

--  In the "keyboard" object, looking at the "hotkeys" page I see an object
    associated with "LeftWin" key. This is one of 3 key mappings I defined
    to use the new "Windows" keys on my keyboard. The (little) problem is
    that it shows only "LeftWin", while the exact hotkey should be
    CTRL+ALT+LeftWin. BTW, it works as expected. Did this even with 0.9.8.

tooltips:
    -- rewrite auto-pop

XWPSetup:
    -- "Undo" and "Default" don't affect newer settings (trashcan);
       PageMage isn't affected

folders:
    -- dragging stuff to folders crashes WPS if folder is being populated
            (probably a WPS bug)

    -- shadows missing if "always sort" and "folders first" are enabled (?!?)

    -- create folder from template doesn't show up in tree view


file exists dlg:
    --  Right click on a file object (program object does not cause this bug)
        select copy.
        >-enter new name(different one), leave it to default folder which should be
        >the one where the file was selected
        >and voila pop-up appears telling user that there is a name conflict, but the
        >new name is not in that folder!

trash can:
    -- When you delete an object, it probably retains its object ID, because
       if a program tries to UPDATE the object that has been deleted, it
       effectively updates the object in the TrashCan, while it should
       create a new one.

NetscDDE:
    -- With the Netscape DDE feature Netscape does not get the right location of
       what to display - the '„' (german Umlaut) gets lost.

OS/2 Kernel:
    -- Set Path -> Browse will not work (Standard file dialog doesn't react when
       OK is pressed -> nothing happens.

    -- Select invalid on classpath selects all zip files.

hotkeys:
       if batchfiles should start in minimized state, from time to time
       they appear on desktop.
        --> check VIO hacks?

PageMage:
    --  bring window to current screen before making it sticky
    --  causes PM lockups at times (Ctrl+Esc unlocks)
    --  stops switching at times
    --  make window larger than desktop, set pagemage 1x4 and move big window
        so it will be in 1 and 2 desktop - switching desktops and moving this
        window causes PM lockup.

hook:
    --  screen borders page:
        object setting won't stick sometimes.

    --  there is a little bug with the settings notebook of the mouse - movement 2.
        I can drag and drop objects to the open object, but it doesn't work with
        the pickup and drop feature of Warp. Than there is no object given.

    --  When Sliding focus is On, in seamless WinOS2 programs like MS Excel
        when you right-click and then move your mouse over the context menu
        it immediately disappears, so you actually cannot use it.

    -- sliding focus:
       -- topmost window doesn't become active after previous wnd destroy

    -- MB3 scroll:
       -- VIEW.EXE TOC not fully shown

    -- VIO copy conflicts with WM_CHORD; check window class. Doesn't work on
       Win-OS/2 either?
