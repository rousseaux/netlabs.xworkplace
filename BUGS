
This file lists bugs known to the current XWorkplace release.
I keep adding bugs which are reported through xworkplace-user@egroups.com
to this file and remove them when they are fixed.

Please don't report bugs which are already mentioned in this file. Thanks.

Even though this file might look dangerously large, this doesn't mean that
XWorkplace is dangerously unstable. Many of the bugs below are only minor
quirks or funny misbehaviors which will not cause your system to hang or
crash. And even if some behavior is not acceptable, you can always disable
XWorkplace features in the "XWorkplace Setup" object.

--  spacing lines are missing on trays

--  rc.exe fails on recreating icons.dll

--  add spacing between icons in folder content menus

--  reboot hangs on "releasing filesystems" on some systems

--  startup folders:
    run in a loop sometimes

--  PageMage:
    window list comes up hidden on different screen

--  XCenter:
    --  if tray is on top, icons are moved down (xwpbug.jpg)
    --  make obj button hatching optional

--  startup:
    boot logo remains on screen forever (check startup sequence for whether
    this might be lost somwhere)

--  drive not ready:
    reports garbage with TVFS drives

--  Font folder:
    >b8) Fontfolder: Deinstalling OS2\DLL\COURIERI.FON, HELVI.FON,
    >TIMESI.FON (file not found errors), fails with error 30024.
    >b9) Fontfolder: Tms Rmn (TIMES.FON) doesn't show itself correctly
    >(i.e. non-sized)

--  XCenter pulse:
    double click should open kernel obj

--  XCenter / folder content menus
     The problem is complex and is related to data files associated
    with VIO windows being started by selecting the data file icon
    (a S3M file, by example) using some folder object on XCenter
    (like the drive folder object).

--  dragging XCenter text files can hang WPS (check file types?)

--  file exists dlg:

    The problem is when you try to copy a file (click copy on the
    contex menu) a Dialog opens where you want to copy it.

    Also you can give it another name by typing it in the edit
    field.

    When you now have enabled "replace file exist dialog" in the
    Xcenter Setup the problem appears as following:

    By copying the file 123.exe for example from D:\ to E:\ the
    file exists dialog from XWorkplace pops up and tells me that
    on the target drive (E:\) a file named 123.EXE already
    exists. (wich does not exists)

--  folder content functions ignore INCLUDe settings

--  setup strings for WPShadow: SHADOWEDOBJECT (?) not reported

--  installation:
    2) Hang on some systems. Dunno what causes this, need to debug more. I can't remember changing anything with the install between 0.9.13 and 0.9.14 (except for making the archive an EXE file), so this really beats me now.
    I'll try to see if replacing the XCenter is causing this maybe.

    3) Trash can disappears after fresh install. I have seen this too now and will
    see how this happens. Strange too. :-/

    4) After screen lockup, hook stops working. OK, that one is easy to trace.

--  if trash can doesn't exist, "drive not supported" comes up

MINOR PROBLEMS
--------------

all windows filters (pagemage etc.):
        -- allow wildcards

sort:
    --  sort by type doesn't sort files with same (or no) type

install:
    --  if lockup on start is enabled, first xwp msg box hangs the system
        after install.

    --  refreshing objects on existing install causes "cannot delete" msgs
        for XCenter, fonts folder etc.

    --  config folder is always replaced.

trash can:
    --  When deleting a folder wich has an other folder inside wich has the
        attribut "read only", destroying of this folder in trashcan will fail,
        some beeps are played and a message appears
        "object xxx cant be deleted - either it is use or write protected"

archiving:
   --  I have archiving enabled when ini files have changed 5%. Just now I rebooted and a
       dialog came up saying "ini files changed 0.000000%, limit 5.000000%" upon which it
       started the archive process. This seems to be a bug, doesn't it?

documentation:
    -- some subsections in the TOC of the user guide are currently
       sorted wrong. This will be fixed in a future release, didn't
       have time now.

file assocs:
    -- My XML engine is currently broken. Do not expect import/export
       to work. Will be fixed soon.

trash can:
    -- shredder deletes into trash can (undo wpDelete change)

    -- When I activate "Replace true delete" (I don't use the TrashCan), I get the
       new XWP dialog when I delete objects via popup menus, but the regular OS/2
       one if I just press the "del" key. Of course I get it all the time if
       "replace true delete" is not active <g>.

    -- When you delete an object, it probably retains its object ID, because
       if a program tries to UPDATE the object that has been deleted, it
       effectively updates the object in the TrashCan, while it should
       create a new one.

       --> not easy to fix at this point, but will be fixed once the file
           handles engine has been reworked.

object hotkeys:
    --  assign doesn't work if hotkey is invalid

prog start:
    --  cmd files not started minimized?

XCenter:
    --  in XCenter X->Run the lookup that finds the executable
        hits on directories as well. Typing Netscape results
        in E:\OS2\INSTALL\NETSCAPE here (which is a directory).

    --  dragging locale object over XCenter crashes WPS

    --  "show frame" setting on a per-widget basis

    --  trays: cycle when clicking on whitespace

    --  tray widgets drag'n'drop doesn't work yet

    --  winlist widget behavior: make buttons wider (configurable)

    --  add "rightmost" setting

    --  allow icon resize

    --  3D border size not respected with "resize desktop"

    --  rework stay on top

    --  template object buttons...

    --  add option for tooltip shadows.

    --  winlist: truncate titles with "..."

    --  XCenter "Run": causes black screen with Win-OS/2 execs

    --  XCenter xbutton: suspend doesn't always work

    --  restoring VIO sessions:
        check in the window words for this.
        For minimized and for maximized there are window
        words for the x and y position.
        If a window has not been minimized/maximized, those
        values will be -1.
        If it was minimized/maximized at least once, those
        values will be <> -1.
        So you might want to check the x and y values for
        the "maximize" window words (while the window is
        not destroyed yet, of course).
        If they are <> -1 then this window was maximized
        and x and y was the maximized position (whatever
        that would be for a maximized window, should be 0
        and 0 ?)

--  folder refresh:
    causes all DLL icons to be reset.

    2001-05-10: cannot easily be fixed without rewriting the entire folder
    refresh mechanism.

--  status bars:
    If the folder status bar is enabled for the Drives folder (using the default
    status bar) and the active Object in the folder is the "Drive A" object the
    WPS hangs after inserting a non-DOS formated Disk.

--  In the "keyboard" object, looking at the "hotkeys" page I see an object
    associated with "LeftWin" key. This is one of 3 key mappings I defined
    to use the new "Windows" keys on my keyboard. The (little) problem is
    that it shows only "LeftWin", while the exact hotkey should be
    CTRL+ALT+LeftWin. BTW, it works as expected. Did this even with 0.9.8.

tooltips:
    -- rewrite auto-pop

XWPSetup:
    -- "Undo" and "Default" don't affect newer settings (trashcan);
       PageMage isn't affected

folders:
    --  sorting: sorts wrong after renaming file (intercept cnr msg)

    --  dragging stuff to folders crashes WPS if folder is being populated
            (probably a WPS bug)

    --  status bars keep accessing wrong drives for LAN objects

file exists dlg:
    --  Right click on a file object (program object does not cause this bug)
        select copy.
        >-enter new name(different one), leave it to default folder which should be
        >the one where the file was selected
        >and voila pop-up appears telling user that there is a name conflict, but the
        >new name is not in that folder!
    --  When i try to copy an existing object in an folder e.g. 123.bmp and
        give it a new name e.g. 456.bmp and press the "copy" button next
        then, the file exists dialog appears telling me that file 123.bmp already exists.

NetscDDE:
    -- With the Netscape DDE feature Netscape does not get the right location of
       what to display - the '„' (german Umlaut) gets lost.

OS/2 Kernel:
    -- Set Path -> Browse will not work (Standard file dialog doesn't react when
       OK is pressed -> nothing happens.

    -- Select invalid on classpath selects all zip files.

hotkeys:
       if batchfiles should start in minimized state, from time to time
       they appear on desktop.
        --> check VIO hacks?

PageMage:
    --  bring window to current screen before making it sticky
    --  causes PM lockups at times (Ctrl+Esc unlocks)
    --  stops switching at times
    --  make window larger than desktop, set pagemage 1x4 and move big window
        so it will be in 1 and 2 desktop - switching desktops and moving this
        window causes PM lockup.

hook:
    --  screen borders page:
        object setting won't stick sometimes.

    --  there is a little bug with the settings notebook of the mouse - movement 2.
        I can drag and drop objects to the open object, but it doesn't work with
        the pickup and drop feature of Warp. Than there is no object given.

    --  When Sliding focus is On, in seamless WinOS2 programs like MS Excel
        when you right-click and then move your mouse over the context menu
        it immediately disappears, so you actually cannot use it.

    -- sliding focus:
       -- topmost window doesn't become active after previous wnd destroy

    -- MB3 scroll:
       -- VIEW.EXE TOC not fully shown

    -- VIO copy conflicts with WM_CHORD; check window class. Doesn't work on
       Win-OS/2 either?
