
This file lists bugs known to the current XWorkplace release.
I keep adding bugs which are reported through xworkplace-user@egroups.com
to this file and remove them when they are fixed.

Please don't report bugs which are already mentioned in this file. Thanks.

Even though this file might look dangerously large, this doesn't mean that
XWorkplace is dangerously unstable. Many of the bugs below are only minor
quirks or funny misbehaviors which will not cause your system to hang or
crash. And even if some behavior is not acceptable, you can always disable
XWorkplace features in the "XWorkplace Setup" object. This applies to
PageMage especially.

SERIOUS PROBLEMS
----------------

--  "create another" for folders can lead to black-screen trap (see readme)


FIXPAK 13/14
------------

This is my private bug list for FP13/14:

-- Sometimes after a WPS restart, the WPS doesn't populate
   the Desktop, and the system hangs. I'm not sure what this
   is about. This doesn't happen with FP11.

-- IBM has ruined the DosQProcStat and DosQuerySysState APIs.
   These still return garbage with FP14 sometimes. Most
   importantly, process monitors cannot show the CPU load
   any more.

-- Apparently, DosPerfSysCall doesn't work any more either.

-- Something's wrong with DosReplaceModule as well. When I
   do an XWorkplace compile and unlock XFLDR.DLL this way,
   I sure get a WPS hang after the next WPS restart. This
   might lead to problems with WarpIN installations, since
   WarpIN can unlock modules too.

-- Please don't complain about misaligned text in Details
   views, which is no longer vertically centered. It's not
   XWorkplace's fault, but another bug introduced with FP13
   or 14, I don't know. I only noticed it now after installing
   FP14.


NOT-SO-SERIOUS PROBLEMS
-----------------------

folders:
    -- dragging stuff to folders crashes WPS if folder is being populated

trash can:
    -- sorting doesn't work right

other settings pages:
    -- XWPSetup: "Undo" and "Default" don't affect newer settings (trashcan);
       PageMage isn't affected
    -- System paths:
       -- scroll listbox to first visible

NetscDDE:
    -- With the Netscape DDE feature Netscape does not get the right location of
       what to display - the '„' (german Umlaut) gets lost.

hook:
    -- hotkeys:
       -- don't work on fresh install

    -- MB3 scroll:
       -- VIEW.EXE TOC not fully shown

    -- VIO copy conflicts with WM_CHORD; check window class
