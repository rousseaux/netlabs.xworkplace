It seems, that I can deinstall the  XFldDisk class without the XFolder class,
but the "installed XWorkplace Classes" page shows, that the class is still active
(after a WPS reboot of course). But this is not correct.
(For reinstalling the class I must double click on XFldDisk.)

trash can:
    -- check for duplicate files in trash can
    -- delete on non-supported drives

icons:
    -- trash can icons...
    -- program file icons changing when settings notebook is opened

drive objects: network drives don't work

semaphore errors...

check dialog pages on Warp 3

create objects:
    -- check "Shift" with creating objects
    -- select editable title

startup folder hangs when "Drive not ready" pops up

hook:
    -- VIO copy conflicts with WM_CHORD; check window class
    -- WM_CHORD over Netscape/PMMail no work
