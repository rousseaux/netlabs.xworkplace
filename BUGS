
This file lists bugs known to the current XWorkplace release.
I keep adding bugs which are reported through xworkplace-user@egroups.com
to this file and remove them when they are fixed.

Please don't report bugs which are already mentioned in this file. Thanks.

Even though this file might look dangerously large, this doesn't mean that
XWorkplace is dangerously unstable. Many of the bugs below are only minor
quirks or funny misbehaviors which will not cause your system to hang or
crash. And even if some behavior is not acceptable, you can always disable
XWorkplace features in the "XWorkplace Setup" object.

SERIOUS PROBLEMS
----------------

--  "create another" for folders can lead to black-screen trap (see readme)

file page:
    -- Opening the context menu of swapper.dat and selecting the "file" strap(?)
       causes a WPS-hangup.
    -- Same with chkdsk.log. Apparently EA handling is buggy somewhere.


NOT-SO-SERIOUS PROBLEMS
-----------------------

misc:
    -- install: XWPScreen no work; probably the old DLL is still in use
       when replaced (DosReplaceModule)

folders:
    -- using WarpCenter moves icons upwards at each WPS startup

status bars:
    -- hidden records are counted in total objects count (Templates folder)

trash can:
    -- open subfolders are not closed when deleting parent folder
    -- sorting doesn't work right
    -- Drives page: multiple selections are not all moved

archiving:
    -- after restoring a backup, archiving is enabled because of the
       date. We should disable archiving when an archive was just
       restored.

startup folder:
    -- The range check at "XFolder Startup"'s settings book ("Setup"?) (why not
       "XWorkplace Startup"?) with "Xworkplace Startup folder" is wrong while getting
       down from 500 to 10000, but from 10000 up to 750. Why no option for 250ms?

OS/2 Kernel:
    -- "Help" button does nothing in "Configure" dialogs
    -- "Optimize" does nothing with CDFS.IFS

other settings pages:
    -- XWPSetup: "Undo" and "Default" don't affect newer settings (trashcan);
       PageMage isn't affected
    -- Clicking "Refresh" in the "object" strap of an object causes a WPS-Hangup.
    -- System paths:
       -- scroll listbox to first visible
       -- check resize controls; crashes on "Close" button

NetscDDE:
    -- With the Netscape DDE feature Netscape does not get the right location of
       what to display - the '„' (german Umlaut) gets lost.

icons:
    -- trash can icons...
    -- program file icons changing when settings notebook is opened

create objects:
    -- check "Shift" with creating objects
    -- select editable title

hook:
    -- auto-hide pointer:
       -- no work when typing in PM window
       -- disappears while MB3-scrolling or Mb1-menus
       -- above WarpCenter menus, the mouse disappears and never comes back. ?!?!?

    -- MB3 scroll:
       -- Netscape hangs
       -- VIEW.EXE TOC not fully shown
       -- I have found that "MB3 window scrolling" function by  XWorkplace 0.9.2
          intercepts "MB3 double click emulation" function in Styler/2.
            --> WM_BUTTON3BEGINDRAG?

    -- VIO copy conflicts with WM_CHORD; check window class

    -- WM_CHORD over Netscape/PMMail no work

    -- function keys (F-keys, Del, Pos, ...) don't work as hotkeys when VIO has focus

    -- Mouse object / Movement: "windows to top" and "Ignore WinOS/2" does not
       ignore WinOS/2 windows.

    -- I had problem with my second installation of XWp. I installed, but
       afterwards it was not possible to check "Enable global object hotkeys"
       unless (afaik) I temporarily turned sliding focus on. (the Hook etc was - of
       course - installed).
       But I reinstalled XWorkplace on a new partition (with a new Warp4, FP12, DDFix,
       ..) and the same happened. I was not able to enable the global hotkeys - unless
       I temporarily turned the sliding focus on. So it is definetely reproducable.

    -- I was still able to trigger the Window list as mouse cursor bug (not as easily,
       though).  I think I did it from PMMail.


PageMage:
    -- maximized windows show border on adjacent screen; hide them when switching...
    -- PageMage client fails to repaint on reshow
    -- PageMage doesn't show up sometimes
    -- Desktop not recognized sometimes
