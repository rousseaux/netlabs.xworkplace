       >So the Kernel object is not much use for me at the moment. How about
       >setting an environment variable in Config.* like

new classes:
    The WPS classes FFolder and WPSAgentSam are used by Samuel Audet's
    (<guardia@cam.org>) open util:

    To be able to filter the contents of a folder using open.exe, you will need to
    register a new folder class found in WPSExtS.dll.  This DLL also includes a fix
    to the background open.  If you want to install both or either of them, you
    will need OS/2 Warp 3 or higher and will need to run "reg.exe i". It is
    preferable that the DLL be placed in a system DLL directory (for example
    x:\os2\dll), unless you specify a directory, ex.: "reg.exe i x:\open" This is
    the same DLL than in Hot Corners 2.0 package, but register with reg.exe just to
    be sure everything is OK for Open. Current version of WPS Extention DLL is 1.0,
    I will try to make all new versions backward compatible.

    Note that the Include page in folder's setting pages is the solution for a
    permanent filtering since open.exe filtering is dismissed on folder close.
