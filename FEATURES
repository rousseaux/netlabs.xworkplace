alt-f4 on desktop shuts down

add zip folders

There's a INI file entry for the font size for VIO windows It's possible to change that
entry; start a new VIO window, and change it back to the original value. I wrote a REXX
script that does this - it's part of my INF file REXX Tips & Tricks. The only strange thing
is, that the name of the key is language dependent.

--  Win32 icon support (shell32\shell32_main.c in odin)
    user32\oslibres.cpp, OSLibWinCreatePointer

--  "Create program object" menu item

XCenter:
    -- X button: give it any icon
    -- XCenter run command: history log
    --  more options for winlist... button size, minimize behavior.
    --  winlist: edit filter entries (instead of remove and add).
    --  freely positionable
    --  Object support for "Run" dialog.. e.g. type in a folder name
        or data file, and have it opened.
    --  "Run" TCP/IP support (ftp, http, etc.)

xfix:
    --  "select by name", e.g. "*.jpg"

shadows:
    --  allow different title (Win95 shortcuts);
        check http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/util/wps/shortcut.zip

everywhere:
    -- remember split bar positions
    -- Shift-click on "Open" submenu items changes default view
    -- inherit folder settings such as "full path"

extended assocs:
    --  WPS file types(!)/associations should be imported automatically,
        somehow. Perhaps for filters without file types new types could be
        created just saying 'PNG file', 'XLS file'... Could be renamed
        afterwards (see 2)
    --  What about files like StarOffice documents? Their first association
        (SO5.1a) is not shown in the open submenu, because they use some
        special WPS class. This association cannot be managed from XWPS. (same
        goes for WordPro, 1-2-3 files I guess).

startup:
    -- environment var for X, Y pos of classes initialization dlg

hook:
    -- delay for screen border objects
    -- move ptr to default button in dialogs (NPSWPS)
    -- Z-order move one/bottommost
    -- an extended Lockup (like the one from PC/2) which can be accessed through a
       shortcut (in the keyboard object).
    -- window list filtering from WarpEnhancer
    -- corners: add user-configurable delay; add user-configurable percentage for
       border/corner ignore space (presently some 80%)
    -- So there's only one reason left for the old Warp Enhancer:
       The quick VIO copy/paste - I'd like to see this in XWP, too.
    -- MB2 frame drag (NPSWPS)
    -- screen corner objects: How about adding modifier-key actions? So that
       pe. Shift-(Mouse-on-left-edge) could have its own action? Could prevent
       accidental open.

PageMage:
    --  draw small icons in pagemage
    --  add backgrounds
    --  add new titlebar button for make sticky
    --  feature to snap all windows to current (context menu item)
    -- When moving windows within the virtual desktop display,
        >they should only be moved from a position in one desktop to
        >the same position in another, except if the user presses e.g.
        >CTRL while dragging - then exact positioning should occur
    --  >- Fullscreen view of virtual desktops (click both
        >mousebuttons -> VD window scales to fullscreen, click again,
        >it scales back)
    --  add tooltips for mini-window titles
    --  if windows appear totally outside of all desktops, move them
        to current
    --  pagemage widget
    --  save window/app positions

folders:
    -- Ctrl+right mouse: folder contents menu
    -- more than one config folder
    -- "invert selection"
    -- sorting: hotkey for reverse sorting / PMMail-like sorting

    -- As an aside, would there be a way to have all desktop decendants
       >(anybody's who's path is X:\desktop\...) to inherit the desktop's "drop
       >as shadow" function? The would prevent/help people from moving folders
       >full of files into the desktop tree (and causing Archiving to EXPLODE!)

create objects:
    -- select editable title

setup strings:
    -- make setup strings editable
    -- create REXX scripts
    -- setup strings for the XWorkplace setup pages in standard setup objects
       (mouse, keyboard, ...)
    -- make object styles editable

OS/2 Kernel:
    -- add page for unparsed CONFIG.SYS lines
    -- add timezone (TZ variable, DosSetDateTime)
    -- >I have one suggestion for the OS/2 Kernel object. I use multiple Config.*
       >files in c:\OS2\Boot to get different WPSs for different family members.
       >So the Kernel object is not much use for me at the moment. How about
       >setting an environment variable in Config.* like
       >    set xwpkernelconfig=c:\os2\boot\config.b
       >and from that determining which Config.* to use for the OS/2 Kernel
       >object?

File page:
    -- allow changing dates

other settings pages:
    -- System paths:
       -- scroll listbox to first visible

sounds:
    -- Do not use default device for WAV files. Instead, open the default
       device and let it play the WAV files.

status bars:
    -- make status bar droppable
    -- add "drive label" mnemonic
    >- to add some more additional codes for file-system objects i.e
    >  $S[s] Shows the file Subject  [short: only first three words]
    >  $C[s] Shows the file Comments [short: only first three words]
    >  $K[s] Shows the file Keyword  [short: only first three words]

trash can:
    -- support DELDIR
    -- add max space used limit

configure color for fly-over help

folder hotkey for deleting THIS folder

archives:
    -- second page with os2.key file which files are 2be archived
    -- csm:
         Ok, no guarantee, but this is what I found out:
             Offset 0xCF: (int32)    "Dateien bei jedem Systemstart aktivieren"
                                         (0 = off, 1 = on/selected)
             Offset 0xD9: (int32)    "Anzeige der Optionen bei jedem Neustart"
                                         (0 = off, 2 = on/selected)
             Offset 0xDD: (int32)    "Zeitsperre fuer Anzeigen der Optionen"
                                         (0 to 999)
         The rest of the file I don't know (besides the path
         beginning at offset 0x06, 200 bytes long)

NetscDDE:
    -- prompt for whether to open a new window

new classes:
    -- The WPS classes FFolder and WPSAgentSam are used by Samuel Audet's
       (<guardia@cam.org>) open util:

       To be able to filter the contents of a folder using open.exe, you will need to
       register a new folder class found in WPSExtS.dll.  This DLL also includes a fix
       to the background open.  If you want to install both or either of them, you
       will need OS/2 Warp 3 or higher and will need to run "reg.exe i". It is
       preferable that the DLL be placed in a system DLL directory (for example
       x:\os2\dll), unless you specify a directory, ex.: "reg.exe i x:\open" This is
       the same DLL than in Hot Corners 2.0 package, but register with reg.exe just to
       be sure everything is OK for Open. Current version of WPS Extention DLL is 1.0,
       I will try to make all new versions backward compatible.

       Note that the Include page in folder's setting pages is the solution for a
       permanent filtering since open.exe filtering is dismissed on folder close.

    -- >I call it WGetFolder. It could be just regular folder, with one small
       >exception. Every URL object dropped on it would be replaced with the
       >file it points to. So the idea is similar to AWget, but it would be
       >much more flexible solution.
       >One could "Create another"->"WGeroup of links. So this way one could easily group files while
       >downloading, instead of having everything in one predefined directory.
       >This WGetFolder could just have another tab in properties, where one
       >could put wget options string for downloading (might be different for
       >different instances of the folder), timeouts etc.
       >I think You feel the idea?  :)

folders in general:
    --  folders without titlebars (XFolder option)
    --  add rexx commands for folder open/close
